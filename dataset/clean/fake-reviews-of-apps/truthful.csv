EDIT: Now after using it for a while, the app has been plagued with reliability issues. It often is late with the notification by a few minutes, or the service completely stops and I'd have to restart the service.

After a few days and several rookie mistakes that aren't explained well in the tutorial, I realized this app is way too heavy on the game mechanics for my use. I want to have a list of dailies to partially complete everyday, to encourage reading and writing every now and then, not everyday. This app punishes you for not checking these things off everyday. I totally didn't realize my character was losing tons of health until it hit the red zone. I then started reading up on the death mechanic and am very turned off. I can understand wanting to give the players consequences for missing a task, but it shouldn't be health loss and it should account for how the player uses the dailies (must complete everyday or bonus if completed). They also do not make it easy to provide feedback. All the discussion links either required creating a separate account (different from the habatica account) or were closed threads.

I could easily send another twenty more, but it isn't worth the time.  This is simply the most bugged piece of software I have ever used.  The avatars are hideous.  The only good thing that this app has going for it is the clean user interface, and a clever separation of the to-do list into three sections.  It is missing some pretty basic to-do list functionality.  The game loads slowly, and doesn't work without an internet connection.  Some of the bugs I've experienced: Reminders pop up on random days, no matter how many times I readjust their settings. Constantly having trouble connecting to the servers. Visual bugs: shows one item, but you get some other item.  Newly equipped main weapon won't show on avatar until app restarted. Progress bars for quests spaz out every time you open the page. Keyboards won't go away once they pop up. And the list goes on and on...",truthful

Mind you, i'd never talk to anyone like that in a public group. i don't mind policing the language of users if they are abusive or using foul language like that in public, but to me its a bit much to ban people for a private conversation, where there was no victims, but its not within my power to change the community guidelines. hopefully i'll get unbanned so i can give the app a swing. it does seem great. only 3 stars for being so quick to jump the ban hammer. will definetly change stars for the better, if the community guidelines loosen up in regards to private conversations and partys. maybe add a report button instead?",truthful
