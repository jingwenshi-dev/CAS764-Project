Exactly what youd expect for $1.99."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"works like it's supposed to. No reason to hate, no reason to get all gushy."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,Dissatisfied regarding how cheaply made this is! Will be lucky if it lasts a year!

Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"although this is really nice stoneware, it is REALLY REALLY heavy

Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,I returned this. It was much smaller than I expected and there was a bent pole.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,Ordered 3 and one was broken. Very disappointed. Two stars though because the candle smells amazing.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,Didn't mix the paint at all. maybe would have been good for a quart. but that's pointless.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"Do not buy, not worth the money. Return time not long enough to test them thoroughly. Disgusted."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"They are ok, don't hold the shape will. Don't mash them or your drink will slosh out."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,Some how I changed the filter with this but indication for carbon on machine never go away

Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"Delivery was exactly as expected.  Bowls were in perfect condition, however they were much smaller than expected."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"This stuff did not adhere very well on the corners of our tables and is nowhere near ""Clear""."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,Takes a while to get enough for noodles but ok product. Your hand might be tired when done.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"Really to strong, was expecting the pleasant aroma of Jasmine, instead got a heavy sweet smell unlike Jasmine."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"The  quality is not that good. When I bake a pie, the silicone cake pan changes color."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"love these bags but one had a hole in it, but a good price for the amount you get"

Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"Total crap, cups are all scratched up and lid seal fell apart in 6 months. Glass is always better!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,Very small and flimsy looking bag. The product info on the webiste is somewhat unclear/misleading. Had to return it.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"Although this tablecloth is so pretty, it tears very easily. It did not last very long on my table."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,I was expecting more.  It's quite a workout to use it and the results were subpar at best.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,Very poor quality.  Thought it would be funny and usable...Problem is that it doesn't fit a wine bottle.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,Arrived with several minor scratches on it. Not bad for the price but the scuffs and scratches bother me.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"Well made, but shape isn't ideal for larger ears. Also they do not nest together, which would have been nice."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,I had this before and loved it this time I can barly get lids off and on-dont know what happened.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,They are hard to get up in the air but when you get one that goes up it is beautiful!
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,Tore apart easier than toilet paper. Its so cheaply put together. Do not waste your time and money.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"Compact, easy to store, easy to use . . .
But not heavy duty at all. Don't try crushing ice, for example."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"These containers are neither leak-proof nor airtight.  However, they are very hand, and I can use them for other purposes."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,not too efficient...small and comfortable to wear; but really didn't give the essential air as it is advertised to do...oh well..
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"Appearance-wise, the toaster is very good looking.  However it toasts unevenly most of the time, no matter what the setting."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"rusted after 1 use in dishwasher, was very happy to mail them back! this is a stainless finish not actual stainless."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"chopped a half cup of walnuts 3 times, the button broke. a piece of trash great when it ran tho."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"Not the clear quality I was expecting, probably won't be using it where I thought I would. It's ok, just not great."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"Not totally waterproof. Front allowed some water thru, but only in upper section. Very long - will shorten. Nice patent leather finish."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,Colors are off white & a pink red color. Returned it since it clashes with my real white & red kit hen.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"A nice idea that my daughter loved, too bad the quality was so poor that it couldn't even last through its Second Use."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,Only received 6 bottles!!!! Also the caps are not the same as whats pictured they are the cheapie looking orange ones. Very disappointed....
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,Worked good at first  until the grooves got clogged. I prefer the hand julienne tool for a better noodle in the end.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,Great chair however the left arm broke off after a few months. I fixed it with gorilla glue. Pretty disappointed in the quality.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"SThey're incredibly thin, rip easily, bleed and are hard to get off the muffins. Splurge for a little more thicker ones, these suck."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,To thin and first time I sat down the string that was tied to chair ripped off. Cheap price still not worth it.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,This is a piece of junk. Do not buy does not work Cheese grater does not work. this is nothing more than a rip-off.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"Gave them several tries. Made sure tile was clean, suction cups were clean, suction properly applied. No go. Cannot recommend. They're in the trash."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,Works relatively well although difficult to hold in my hand.  I would probably get the Zyliss if I were to do it over.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"very, very thin material with some sharp edges.  I had to hide it in fear my grand daughter would cut herself on it."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,I was surprised when I went to use it there was not any markings for 1/2 or 1/4 cups.  Therefore the 3 stars.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"These are serving their purpose of keeping down from escaping, but the ones I got from the Company Store are much softer and nicer."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,It's a good idea but bin is made in China and looks cheap so you'll be paying way too much for what you get.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,Great at the beginning but the candle will not burn all the way. Only got 3/4 of the way and the wick was done
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"Do you really need four huge holes at the back for cables? Not shown in the pictures.
received warped pieces and poor alignment of attachments."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,i was burning with a charcoal and sage guess it got to hot and bottom rim came off other then that i love it
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,With the price I was really hoping this would work for drying shoes but the straps are not long enough to fit my dryer door.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,These were a bit disappointing.  I was expecting a heavy poster paper and these were on regular colored printer paper.  I returned them.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,The nonstick part works fine. But the bottom of the pan is not flat and therefore does not sit evenly on my ceramic top stove.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,I received this product with an expiration date for last April. Didn't work well. The yeast didn't activate. I am very disappointed with this product.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,I can't push on it hard enough to get it to dispense the salt. My husband can use it well enough. Am sorry I bought it
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"They bent every time we tried to drive them in, not strong enough to hold. For many of the shutters we had to use screws instead."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,These are just okay. They will not work to cool your room temperature or warm drink but work to keep it cool for hour or so.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"I'm disappointed. 1 bowl has a chipped bottom & 2 bowls have pitted insides.
I would return them for refund but I need these for a dinner."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"The knives don't work well as steak knives.  The serrated blade tears apart whatever you try to cut, rather than slicing.  Throwing them out."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,The inside liner already has mold after only a couple of months so the PEV is not as good in preventing mold from damp as it sounds
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"The bed frame glide replaced the wheels attached to my bed. It was a simple process to do, pulled the wheels off and attach the bed glides."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"I have had it One year and the display stopped working and only way  to get the thing on is with the remote.
currently fighting with company"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,My hands are quite arthritic and this has really be a help in opening all sorts of bottles and jars.  It is easy to use and works!
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,Depends on what you want to drink. If you are using for coffee there are better alternatives at a lot lower price. It is a good beer glass.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,Large knife chipped the first time i used it.  I know that ceramic knives are more fragile but I was being very careful and it still chipped...
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,As a strainer this works but i was looking to buy this to use with my 8 Qt instant pot which due to the handles makes it now fit.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,I though a square cake pan would be great but is hard to cut and display on a round cake stand. I will have to purchase a square stand.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,Not really effective at all.  This is NOT tacky like the original product. It does not hold a candle in place at all.  it is not thick.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,Doesn't fit any of the tissue boxes I have in my home.  I think it will only take a smaller size (not the large ones that I buy).
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"Pretty, but dents and scratches easily.  I have placed this in an area where there is very little traffic, and it is still dented.  The wood seems soft."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,Purchased this to scoop directly from the coffee bag (I think that's what it's called). Problem is that it pushes back in very easily. The extender is pretty much useless.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"Nice looking and well made, however, I had to return it because the fan was too loud for me.  I could not operate heater in my bedroom at night."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,Love love love the feeling of bamboo sheets but the fitted sheet does not fit the thicker mattress well at all. Pops off the mattress every night we've used them.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,Board was used it has MANY knife cuts in it. Does not have John Boos logo on it as picture shows. Not even sure its the same product. Not happy.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"Well if you're like me you will get the queen size in when you ordered the king. Even the package said king size. The material felt good, but to no avail."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,Had to buy 2 and cut to fit since we have a four-foot shower. It doesn't work that well but it's passable. Doesn't anybody make what's needed for these larger showers.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,I was very disappointed in this product.  I thought it was very cheaply made.  It had plastic and not glass for the front and it was all scratched up.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"Update, my last 5 containers were bent on each end which made my cupcakes lean. So happen I just ordered from Websturant and was able to use the new ones."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,These suck.  If you put them in the refrigerator they pop off.  Good luck getting them on to begin with.  Hopefully I can find a use for them.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"Smelled bad, very bad the first few days. Rotting grass small.

It had good support first few days. But then the support fizzled and the pillow turned into a pancake.

Not worth the price."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,A little small but works well.  The chair is super light weight and I had to put rubber non skid pads under the legs to keep people from sliding too much.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"I  was looking for a soft glow but these are even more yellow than in the photo (I'd assumed it was ""enhanced"") and are much more artificial than I've seen elsewhere."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"The color is much darker in person. The material is nice and soft, but I wanted something a little lighter yellow to match my room. It's much more of a mustard color"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"These are quite cheap in terms of quality.  You get what you pay for, I know, but even for $6 it could at least look like it wasn't going to leak ASAP."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"holes too big, leaves fall out. Will try wetting the leaves next time and see if that helps, but in general its annoying. For context I'm using davidson's bulk tea which is great."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"What a piece of junk. All drawer fronts were scratched up, particle board is extremely cheap. Took hours to assemble and was impossible to return. Don't waste your time, invest in something better."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,The back can NOT be easily removed like literally any other picture frame on the planet. Be prepared to work and I hope you want to keep those pictures in there for awhile.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"Delivered June 26th, 2015. Stopped working August 23 2015.

Two months and amazon will not take it back.

Update: Took it to service center and received new one from Black and Decker within two weeks."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"n my opinion, the image is deceiving. To me, the image looks tapered, which is why I purchased this one over others. It is not tapered it is the basic Mason Jar shape."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,Love the skillet but so disappointed. I've been waiting for this to arrive and it has a big gash right out of the box! Now have to endure the returning and replacing hassle.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"Hard to drink out of, since the structure ""collapses"" when you grip the ""glass"". The silicone is not firm enough so you have to get used to the glass to not spill the wine."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,Pretty but not functional. Fabric is too light and it doesn't stay in place whatsoever no matter how often you adjust it. Give it 3-stars due to the description being accurate and loving the color
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,I bought this to cook brown rice...It takes a LONG time to cook! It also takes up a LOT of space on my counter.  Not sure I'll use it all that much for fact.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,Product is no good. Only works 1 time out of 6 uses. Don't buy! It's a piece of crap. Not even going to give it away; throwing it in the trash. I waste of money!
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"Cooks pasta just fine. Could do the same with any bowl! What I didn't like was there is a 1/2"" ridge in the bottom and the pasta sticks in there bad and hard to get out!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"Very cheap. The food gets stuck in the blade. You have to take it apart, get the food out, then try to chop again. Who wants to cut up good before they chop it? Doesn't work."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,The stool looks good and is sturdy but the cushion is super thin.  Sitting on the stool becomes a bit uncomfortable after a while.  The company should definitely add more cushion to the stool.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"OMG, if you are prone to back spasms, DON'T use this!! I was bed ridden for three days on pain killers, muscle relaxers and anti-inflammatories after waking up from just one night of sleeping with this!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,The smokes don't fit in the grooves.  It's as if the plastic cooled to much and shrunk when manufacturing.  Had to smash the ciggs to get them to fit instead of them going in effortlessly.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"This item has one function, and doesn't hold up to that function. The sides of the ball don't close tight enough to prevent little particles of tea getting into your water. Don't buy it, get something else."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,Totally disappointed in this product. Haven't had a good batch of ice cream yet.  The outside freezes but the inside stay soft. And then when you put it into the freezer it turns into ice crystals
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"Although a good price, these smell like rotten fish. Brides - beware. Open at least a week before the wedding and separate your petals. I had to spray mine daily and the smell was still not gone."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"This is well made and works OK, but the bulb has a tendency to fall off of the stainless baster shaft, especially when it gets wet. Overall, it works well, I just wish the bulb fit better."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,Love the print and color of these rugs but they are very very thin. Great accent pieces but the runner is an unusual size and the small area rug is very small.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,I thought this would be a perfect keep at work filtered water solution yet the space the filter takes up makes this somewhat clunky tumbler's capacity limited to 26 oz and as such need of frequent refilling.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"Flimsy, JUNK, hardly a  Panacea, Not nearly worth the money.
Has the worst assembly instructions I have ever seen,  omitting information as how to sequence the pieces
so as not to require disassemble to position the parts properly."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"The serving closure on the top will not lock you will have to tape it down if you carry it, and that's  why I brought this item! I learned this the hard way. Brought two of these:-("
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,I ordered these bags and was sent some cheap Version and knock off. I am terribly disappointed in what they sent me. But of course at this price point it's not worth my time to it send back.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"I didn't buy them for the quality. I bought them because my granddaughter wanted to tie dye a set of sheets. I usually like a much higher thread count, but these were great for what I had in mind"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"Although this opener does not separate the top from the sides, it seems to cut quite well without shards of metal in the can. Sometimes it has trouble grabbing the can and it has refused to open a few."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,I got these to hang in one of the bathrooms with the litter box to get rid of the litter box odor. Hung both of them in the bathroom but did not get rid of the litter box odor.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"Nice material, but isn't all that practical to me. I reverted back to squashing garlic with my knife to peel and manually chopping it. Other times I just use my food processor for bulk garlic and mason jar storage."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,It was not put together already so we spent a long time attempting to create each tassel which was an extremely tedious process. I do not recommended this product unless you have time to put it together before hand.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"The quality was so bad it was laughable. The plastic is so flimsy that it won't latch shut without a  gap. Not exactly going to seal in the freshness. Also, the plastic ""hinges"" look really fragile. I'm returning it."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"Two of the pans worked fine. The 8"" pan didn't. I had to put a 6""x6""by 1/8"" steel plate under it to get it to work. The non-stick coating works as expected. For the price it is what it is."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,Usable but not as good as a namebrand one I've use.  The vacuum seal part is a little silly with having to turn clockwise and counter clockwise.  But ok - you pay for what you get is true.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"It's alright.  The hair catcher doesn't stay put when washing hair in the sink, but this is just my situation.  This may work well for others.  The item is well made, with small ""teeth"" to catch hairs."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"Sturdy hammer, great price. Projections of tenderizing face are rather shallow; may not penetrate meat enough to do the job. Handle is not as comfortable as I had hoped. I may wish to exchange the item for a different design."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,I am very disappointed with this product.  The cheese slicer broke at the base of the handle in less than 6 months.  i used this product to  slice colby cheese  five to six times a week.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,Awful soap dispenser. I would give it no stars if I could. The bottom is screwed on. Plus it leaked from both the bottom and the top where the seam is. I had to throw it away. Complete waste of money.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,Was so disappointed this is so small not worth the money then there was a metal rod in the box I guess to add weight. I will not buy from this seller again it was an embarrassing gift for my daughter
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"The quality for the metal branches is not that great, the edges are sharp too. They are mediocre, got them for my formal dining room, but will use them for casual dining instead. The pics look better than the actual product."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,It doesn't stay in place well. After a number of hot water experiences it still does not lie flat. The suction cups don't work well in our jacuzzi because the floor is not smooth. It is still nice to lay on.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,Just received it last night. Took it out of the packaging and there are some stains on it. Not sure from what. It's for my daughter and she will try it in a week and I'll be able to comment on comfort.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"You have to have some dainty little teacups for these things to hold more than 2. The quality is very poor; each hook is a slightly different shape and size than the others. Very unstable on the shelf, too. Waste of money."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,This is about half the size of what I expected. From top to bottom it will hang maybe half way down in your closet. To give you an idea of the size each pocket area holds about a half dozen sock pairs.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"Purchased one of these just over a year ago. Was fine for that period of time and suddenly stopped cooling. Company is no help. Three calls, three referrals to service companies, two of which do not work on Avanti, one out of business."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"Flimsy construction, and warped. I bought 3 and they are all this way. However, in my cabinets with moderate weight, they are functional. Would not buy again but considering these were the cheapest available for this size, I got what I paid for."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"Funny gag apron and it turns the girls heads for sure, made a little cheaply and runs small, but it's worth it.  Can't complain, it's the only time I could get my wang touched by women without my wife getting upset!  lol"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"magnet doesn't have much strength so really cant be used that way,I was going to send it back until I found a way to wedge it into a cupboard and now its a wee bit better,the alarm works well and is easy to use"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"i bought these partially for the fact that they're nonstick.  well, after the 3rd time using the middle one, one area in no longer nonstick. so now i need to grease and flour. so , back to the basics.  otherswise, nice pans."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,I actually LOVED it when it worked. Unfortunately it quit after two months of occasional use. I didn't use it every day but probably 10 times in a two month period and then it just quit. It wouldn't do anything at all. Very disappointing.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"These logs maybe last about an hour. As soon as you light them up they start breaking down and falling apart. I bought them from Home Depot for $20 which was a complete waste of money. Any other brand will be better, trust me!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"Seemed like a good value, but a couple of the packages had either old or defective batteries in them. Not sure I would order this brand again. In a home where there are three hearing aides, it's important to know the batteries on hand work."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,This thermostat worked great at first but soon crapped out. This is the second digital thermometer that I have tried this grilling season with both failing. I have since ordered the old school analog thermometer. I have had these last for years. Live and learn.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,I love this steamer and was ready to rate it 5 stars but it broke on me (last time I used it was a few months ago so I'm not sure what happened). I am disappointed that it didn't last me longer than 2 years.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"I like the bed cover, however, it sheds lint like crazy. Ive washed it three times on delicate cycle and dried it on delicate cycle as instructed but it still has a bunch of lint all over the place. Im hoping it will stop soon."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"didn't realize mine was coming from china, took a little over a week, so not too bad.  Not really any brighter than the 3 LED I replaced with it.  No battery compartment, guess you have to unscrew the cover if battery needs replaced."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,Smells good but no foam.  I put it in three different foaming dispensers and NO FOAM just gel oozing out.  Bummed me out but I can still wash my  hands with the gel.  Just wanted foam. Got the wrong thing I guess.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"I purchased this tablecloth to use on Easter.  I removed it from the packaging and washed it in cold water on the ""hand wash"" cycle and dryed it on low.  It came out completely unusable.  It was full of snags, runs and wrinkles."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,Not the highest quality by any means. It works and looks good. The corners are like blades that cut the legs of anyone unfortunate enough to walk too close. We had to buy padded bumpers to put on the front corners to avoid more pain and bloodshed.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"It isn't bad, good for the price.  However, it is shipped folded in half, and rolled up, so it takes a while to flatten.  It is very light, so movement (even walking) on it, pulls it out from under the furniture and it bunches up."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"Wife likes them.  I was a little concerned after the first round through the dishwasher as one of the bowls developed a wobble instead of sitting flat on the counter.  It turned out the I needed to ""pop-it"" back out and is like new again."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,I ordered two of these and one is a very tan color (as in the image) and one is dark brown. The inner parts are not at all finished and the quality just doesn't look very good. Spend a little more for something that will look good.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"This puts out very little oil. It's hard to tell if it's even working. The reason I can tell is that it sounds like it is boiling when it is on. There is definitely a boiling water sound, so I don't know that the ""whisper"" name applies."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,These are great for the first few months. A few of my pieces (the whisk and spatula to be specific) have fallen a part and I have since had to throw them away. The tops of them start to slip off and won't stay on while you're cooking.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,Very creaky.  Not a good buy.  The slats kept falling out because they weren't cut long enough.  You will probably have to get a metal platform base in addition to this frame.  I did.  Better to buy something else that's actually solid wood.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"Found the colors to fade together to be a pale-ish light red rather than a distinguishable red and white check .  They are short, not at all generous.  Once baked, the colors is almost lost. Pulled away from baked goods avg. Won't opt to purchase again."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,After I received these I realized that they go on the outside of the window. This will not work for my applications. I do like the maple leaf look so I was sad. I am sending this to the thrift shop and hope someone else can use it!
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,Easy to put together took about 15 minutes solo.  Reasonably comfortable - not the best I've used but I like the look and it seems fine for my home office.  If I was sitting in it 6+ hours a day I'd probably go for something else.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"I had a hard time contacting the manufacturer/distributor in order to make sure the measurements were correct. The description and the .pdf have completely different dimensions.
In reality, these didn't fit at all. Extremely short!
Fabric is very thin. I consider these are well overpriced for what the product really is."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"Seemed to be just fine and then suddenly just quit working after about 6 months. Cleaned the terminals on battery, etc. Nope - it's a goner. Not my unit as I had the old Dyson battery. Charged it up and it runs my unit. Try another brand I guess."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,Nice looking and not too hard to construct...but made out of very FLIMSY particleboard and CHEAP inferior material... the veneer was soooo thin that it is almost not there... there were many chinks and damaged surfaces in the top piece and the whole thing is just not good quality.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"Super cute, but realistically I'm not sure how anyone makes these work as advertised.  I haven't tried them myself.  My 15 yr old daughter wanted these and after trying once and it being kind of a pain they are now just taking up space in my cupboard."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"I bought these for my office which has windows that are very awkward in size. I did really like the curtains, although they didn't really look like the picture when they were hung. The only thing I really didn't like was the ""moss"" color; it was not flattering at all."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"The Dreamaway Comfort Fill Mattress Protector was good for a while but then problems arose.  First was that the fill compressed in the center, which created a shallow dip in the center.  Next the top material pilled too much; some pilling was expected but this became too excessive."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"Have been using these (bought two) for a few weeks now and they are working nicely. Nice design. Don't even need the fancy controls, but the fan is nicely designed and cranks the flow of air nicely.

UPDATE: One has broke already!!! Stay away - more garbage I'm sorry to say!!!!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"Upon opening these had a very strong chemical smell. After washing the smell went away.

After showing I used the towel and it wasn't very soft, it was soft enough but it didn't seem as absorbent as my regular use towels. These will work as guest room or backup towels though."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"This would hypothetically be a fantastic way to burn incense if it worked. However, incense will not stay lit when using this holder. You will have to light an incense 20 times for it to burn the entire way to the end of the stick. Stay far far away from this."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"NOT COPPER!!!!

This is a cheap stainless steel mug with copper plating on the outside. A TRUE Moscow Mule needs to be in a copper mug, not stainless. The picture and title are very deceiving. I returned mine when I got it. It also seemed much cheaper made than what is pictured."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"I like the color on bottom for keeping track of your own glass.  The have a little waviness to the sides - I wasn't expecting that, but it doesn't really bother me.  They are a little fragile and they have a dip in the bottom that holds dishwasher water."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"like someone else mentioned, this doesn't work with headphones....was on a long haul flight;  thank goodness i had my iPhone earbuds. yes,the designers of this pillow would to well to make a loop on one end of the pillow so it can be secured around the neck with those drawstrings."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"I followed the washing instructions exactly, these sheets made a million fuzzy balls that get all over the bedroom. So, I thought to wash them again and hopefully be rid of the fuzz balls - nope, didn't help. Trashed em and went to Costco, bought a set I am delighted with."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"On the box it smells heavenly. But as I suspected, when it burns the scent is more like a burning perfume. Not as delicate as other incenses that I tried. This is just my opinion.
I keep them in my drawers and closet, and they scent beautifully without the need of lighten them!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,The picture posted for this item is a fraud. It shows 3 pots and 2 pans with 2 lids. What you actually get are 3 pots and 2 lids.  It is very deceptive and this company should be ashamed. To return it you have to pay a 20% restocking fee. Very disappointed.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,Not happy with this product. I left plenty of space around it and it has more dust sticking to the outside than the filter. It doesn't take long for the replacement filter light to come on and the filters are very expensive. I can't say I have noticed a change since using it.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"The stuffing moves to the path of least resistance. So if you sleep in the middle, soon the foam will move away from your head and you end up in a ""hole"". If you like scooping and molding the stuffing throughout the night to ensure you have the proper neck support, go for it."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,i have had this clock for a while and it drive me nuts. i have had to fix the time over and over i don't know if its normal but i took the batteries out and not bother using it. i need clock for my kitchen but i can find a different one .
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"This product was a disappointment. I was surprised by how light the box was. I couldn't understand until I opened it. The inside of the bean bag chair seems to be a form of styrofoam shipping peanuts. The outside of the bag is not much better - very low quality ""suede"". Not worth the money."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,Was really looking forward to this steam mop what a disappointment.  Does not work on high steam.  The steam fresh attachment does not stay attached.  Would like to return but now that it is assembled the handle cannot be unattached.  Don't buy this product keep shopping for one that totally works.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"DO NOT BUY! Scam. Only one glove received instead of two. They are not as heat resistant as claimed. Burned my hand while removing hot pan from oven. Heat from pan went right through glove. Interesting that this product has all these negative reviews, yet it has a 4 star rating. Hmmm . . ."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"LOL, I just picked this up at BJ's for $6. 00. Used it and was pleased with product. Only negative is the shape of the container - too big for my microwave so it doesn't turn on the turner, but just as well. pasta came out perfect. No more cleaning pots and strainers."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"Great looks but the design is really poor.  Water gets stuck under the bottle, which rusts the bottom.  Mine is already leaking.  I can't imagine why they could not make a bottle that is attached to the caddy, and allow drainage in the caddy part of this soap dispenser.  I'm very disappointed."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"Beautiful in appearance. Very comfy to sit on and use as a guest bed. Disappointed in 1 of the arms that had several  (actually 4) cracks in the arm of the futon. Husband put it together , and didn't notice them until it was fully assembled. Too much trouble to take apart, repackage and send back."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"I order this through prime now... this is the third one this year. It smells horribly of plastic on the highest setting, and they eventually break. I just bought a new one December 7th and the previous one was ordered in August. It works and its inexpensive, but I think I will try something else next time!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"This works well and sucking gunk out of window sills.  However, it will NOT charge.  It only worked for 5 weeks and now will not charge.  Of course, my ""return"" window closed after 45 weeks, so I am now out $32.  I won't order from Black & Decker through Amazon again.  Very disappointed."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"After using this for the past year or so, some if the clips are starting fall off kind of easily.  No big deal, just push it right back on the rope.  For the price, it's definitely worth it.  Great for display if you don't plan on taking your hats on and off of it much."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"I used this to protect a 7 inch Santoku knife. But I never felt that this guard was very securely on. Even cut my finger once when inserting the knife because the knife edge passed through the top of the guard and my finger was there.

I highly recommend that you get a sheath/cover/saya which completely enlcoses the blade."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"Wish I could rate this higher, but the scissors cut poorly, the magnet holder sticks to nothing that will support the scissors. Have used these to pry things open. Good if you are desperate for a pair of scissors and this is the only pair you can find, pretty much have to gnaw your way through anything plastic."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"It looks very nice, but it feels very cheap. Not heavy, 3 year old gave me a scare when he opened all of the drawers and this thing fell forward thank goodness the room is narrow and the bed managed to save him it landed on bed. Anyway If this is for a kids room get something sturdy."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"It has a horrible strong chemical and plastic smell that doesn't go away even after being washed with soap several times. I also tried leaving soaking in water with dishwashing soap for four days and the strong chemucsl and plastic smell remains. The bad thing is that the odor gets into the Q-Tips.

Beautiful design but not good product materials."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"I would give this zero stars if I could.  It opened THREE normal sized cans - very, very, very slowly.  Then it stopped working and just made clicking sounds.  Absolutely worthless piece of junk.  The concept is good, and I think others make better ones.  But this one was a total waste of $20."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,I was looking for a simple inexpensive butter dish to replace the one broken by my dog. This one is a mite small and does squish the corners of the butter but it does the job. If you have twenty bucks or so to spend buy a better butter dish. If not you'll find this one to be adequate.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,I am furious. I waited months to buy this as it was on my Xmas list. Didnt get it as a gift so I bought it for myself the next day. Arrived with missing pieces. I am missing a screw and its pointless. The most expensive little shelf and they cant even count the screws right. Beyond mad right now.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"This serves the purpose that it was designed to do, and was delivered promptly. It is as described. However, one complaint I have is that the shelves are not re-inforced with any type of material (like cardboard), so they sag in the middle. Imagine thin fabric shelves rather than structured ones. Other than that, it does what it is supposed to."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"Meh. Rug does not resemble photos, colors are much deeper and stand out more. Quality seems to be OK, but certainly not so great for the price point. If you need an area rug, it will do....but its much more difficult to incorporate ANYTHING other than neutral colors. Would not recommend for the price, and if i could return? I would."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"While the boxes are nice, the clasps that hook onto the cover or another container are flimsy and break easily.  I WASN'T a happy camper when carrying the whole contraption down to the basement and the cover popped off because of a broken clasp.  Fortunately, only 4 ornaments broke.  I will be buying a different storage container next year."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"The magnets weren't strong enough to hold it up on the side of the fridge.  It kept sliding down. So I found a set of magnetic refrigerator hooks that had a super strong magnet on the back and put it under the coffee pod holder. It works fine now. I wish I could use the magnetic hooks for their original purpose, though."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"I was about to purchase this item until I noticed that ALL BUT 2 of their feedback ratings are all listed within a day or two of each other.  If you click on each reviewer, you will see they have only reviewed this one item in their entire history.  6 of 8 of the reviews here clearly seem to be illegitimate."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"Super scratchy fabric. I was anticipating something a little softer. Still, the print is great and so far the pillow case is holding up after being laid on a few times. I'm pretty happy with the colors and the case looks exactly as it's advertised. It was folded in a small square for delivery and I had to iron it to make it smooth."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"As the title states, it does its job decently (It could be better) but it is really flimsy. After applying pressure to it you have to trace it back with something otherwise you won't be able to notice the shape. I used it for a couple of times VERY carefully and it broke anyways, so caveat emptor.

Would not recommend unless you don't find anything else."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"Nice shoulders, but the pants bars do not have any grippy coating as advertised.  The pants fall off pretty easily.  I may wrap it with SeranWrap to see if that will hold them on...I generally prefer hanging trousers by the cuffs anyway to help shed wrinkles.  I bought these for the suit coats, and they preserve the shape on those supremely well."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"I bought this stool three years ago and it is loose and wobbly.  It gets some use, but not over used by any means.  I tighten it weekly now and its just not good.  I would not recommend this stool for that reason.  It fit where I needed it and it looked good, but time to replace it with something else."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"These candles are advertised as fitting in the christmas chimes, but the thickness of the candles does not fit in any of the ones we have.  We have two versions of the standard ones, but these candles are not made for them.  The red ones are the right size.  I kep the red ones and returned the white ones and got a refund."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,I ordered an entire bamboo set. I also ordered two of these glasses. They arrived at my home and both plastic glasses were cracked. One actually had a hole in the bottome and it did not look like it occurred from shipping. Not worth sending them back but won't buy them again and would not recommend that anyone buy them.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,So disappointed. I had one of these for 10 years until it finally broke.  I purchased this one and it broke as soon as I used it.  The design is flimsy and cheap.  The batteries fell out and the top doesn't stay put.  Night and day from the same make that I had for 10 years.  Must be made in China now.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"I like the concept and that it has the words in Korean and English, but the execution didn't work well for me. The bags don't stand up without the plastic dividers and it's just not convenient to carry them the way it is set up. I may update my review, but I haven't been able to use this. I wish there was one for glass as well."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,Not crazy about these. This is my second set. The first ones looked like a film was forming on the glass. I had them for quite a while so I didn't return them. Purchased the second set and they did the same thing. I have this pattern in the dishes and wanted plastic glasses because of them being in a motorhome.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"I love that these cutters come in a set but a couple of them are smaller than expected. The baby bottle is small and so is the rattle.  The rubber duckie is also smaller than my other rubber duckie cutter. Not as small as a ""mini"" cutters but not as a large as a standard cutter.  If you are making favors, these are perfectly sized, however."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,I'd had a Brita pitcher for about fifteen years and decided to replace it because it was getting a little grimy. I bought this one and the handle broke off within a week. I've just ordered another style which has the handle attached at the bottom as well as the top (like my old one did) and hope to have better luck. I suggest you do the same.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"For me, this pillow wasn't a good fit!  It is an extremely heavy, very dense pillow!  Initially it seemed comfortable enough, but quickly lost its shape!  I have to continually flip it and reshape it.  I was expecting soft memory foam, but it is very firm.  Fabric is nice and it seems very well constructed.  It just isn't the right pillow for me."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"I hated this neck pillow! It was so uncomfortable and I couldn't even use it. It's too round and bulky, so your head is too far away from your seat so you have to lean forward. And the opening/curve is so shallow so it fits awkwardly around your neck. I essentially carried this pillow around Japan for 2 weeks just so I could return it when I got home!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"""Leakproof?"" Not hardly! Ever had stewed cheesecake? That's what one of the two of these I purchased and used today for the first time produced. When I unhooked the clasp, water leaked out. and the entire bottom inch of my little cheesecake is soggy. Despite their pricey-ness, these things are made in China. They're going back to Amazon--which, thank you Jeff--stands behind every product they sell. (I'd recommend ditching this one, Jeff."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"Used the item once. The lid was unbelievably tight, it wouldn't budge. Finally, I pried it off and gave it a go. Completely underwhelming. I used mini ice cubes and the motor was still strained to the point of smoking. Also, there is no way this should be marketed as a travel cup, the blender attachment is in the bottom of the cup and the cup itself is massive."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"These votive candles are fine as votive candles; the problem was they were bought because they were supposed to be 12-hour candles. Tried 6 candles and on an average they burned about 3 1/2 hours - a good bit short of 12-hours.  This box of Dynamic Collections Unscented Votive Candles has printed on the label that they are 12-hour candles, so the error is not on the seller's part."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"The ""polish"" already shows lots of scratches, though I can not tell if it is that or the steel itself.  The thick glass lids are very good, and they actually can match other pans and visa versa.  There's very little problem with food sticking after light use.
Three Stars because there is evidence of being stained from the electric stove, so they are not in fact ""stainless"" as suggested."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"When it comes to warmth and overall quality I'd say its durable and very warm. Would not suggest hot summer/spring nights, it gets way to warm and you find it hard to stay comfortable. It stays together when you wash it. Just when I try to switch sides and roll over I find my clothes sticking to it making it very hard to switch from side to side."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"Very cheap, does not fit tightly or properly on the bed, had threads coming off after the initial wash/dry cycle to get rid of the smell. Just feels cheap. Would not recommend. I'm also not convinced it's actually cotton. Feels like polyester. If I had known that I would not have bought it, would not recommend.

It's nice that it's so cheap, but in this case you really get what you pay for."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"Really cool concept, but it wouldn't cut my veggies all the way because there was a gap between the board and blade. I added a photo and you can clearly see the gap. Maybe I just got a faulty item? Maybe not. Also, in the video reviews I've seen the safety clip as a red piece but the one I received is black all over. Could be a fake. Would not recommend."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"When I went to screw the charges in the first few times, the metal took the skin off my finger. A few days later I noticed both of my pointer fingers had a chunk of skin missing and I'd be bleeding and have no idea why, until the 3rd time it happened and then I figured it out. Very sharp and dangerous. You can see how it can happen in the picture."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,Ok I say again WHO is writing these reviews. For $89 this is a total rip off. The candle holders are made of pressed aluminum. The stand is Saturday and in 3 screw together pieces. It's painted a fake gold or bronze color. I hope that Amazon puts a stop to these customer reviews that are false and miss leading. Had the price been $29.99 then it would be a great value.

Always remember that. These are inexpensive and cheap. Yes, those two words mean different things. These are one step above disposable plates.
Three plates were not flat on the bottom; three plates had noticeable indentations; four pieces had imperfections in the gray trim; one bowl cracked perfectly in half after setting it down on the counter."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"It works as a lift but not as I wanted it for which was to be able to place a dish under it and cook in two dishes at once in my pressure cooker. The legs are no where as long as in the image. Not sure if the product was changed from original images, but the legs are not tall at all.

That said, it is sturdy and works so we are keeping it"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"The plates are okay.  We ordered 2 boxes (12 plates total), and both boxes snapped open during shipping, chipping the edge of one plate.  The Black circular imprint is well done, but not quite centered in the plates, and each plate exhibits some 'uniqueness' in shape.  They are fine for our purpose and the price is certainly nice.  Was hoping for more here, but you do get what you pay for."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"THESE CONTAINERS ARE HORRIBLE!  THEY DON'T STAY CLOSED!  I BOUGHT THIS BRAND SEVERAL YEARS AGO AND THEY ARE STILL FINE.  THESE ARE THINNER AND CHEAPER!  $60. DOWN THE TOILET!  I HAD TO USE BUNGEE CORDS TO CLOSE THEM.  I'D
HAVE SENT THEM BACK HAD THE BOX NOT BEEN SO BIG!  USE A CARDBOARD BOX AND PUT IT INSIDE A LAWN & LEAF BAG.  IT
WOULD WORK JUST AS WELL."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,I had previously bought the white desk for my daughter and was happy with it. So I decided to order another one for my son. The red one that I received today is ridiculous. The entire thing looks like it's covered in a thin paper. There are faint brown lines on the legs that is peeling away as well as scratches. I'd return it if it wasn't such a hassle. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"Good basic turner - flexible enough (would like it better if more so).  HOWEVER, the edges are sharp - not thin, but with a rough burr from the stamping process used to make the head.  Actually managed to cut myself.  Not a bad cut, but enough to tick me off.  I will need to use some emery paper to try to smooth it down a bit.  Price is right, though."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"Addendum review.  I love this cart, right size, versatile, sturdy and mobile (have my KitchenAid mixer on top).  However, the hard plastic casters are scarring my oak hardwood floor. I have been online for hours trying to find a better replacement caster = 1/4-20 x 1"" threaded stem with SOFT rubber wheel.  Can not find all specs in one caster.  Frustrated and disappointed. Still looking...

May have found replacement casters.  Hope so."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"I had to buy this pepper mill after reading the glowing reviews. There is just one problem with this pepper mill. It does a very poor job of grinding pepper. After grinding for several minutes, only a dusting of pepper is delivered. I have it set on 2 as I prefer a finer grind. My experience is nothing like the reviews. It really makes me wonder if anyone acually used this mill prior to reviewing it."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"The furniture was well packed, however the seat if one chair was cracked all the was through on his one side and the top of the table was scratched and the paint on one part was marred. There is no way this happened during shipment. So very disappointed that someone would pack and ship these damaged items. In the plus side I called kid craft and they are shipping our replacement pieces. The furniture does seen solid."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"The concept is great and it really does make the meatloaf better.  I wish the ledges of the top pan were extended so it would be easier to separate the two pans.  It's really tricky when the pan is hot.  If I had known this I probably would have went with a different brand that had this option, but at the time of ordering I didn't realize how much easier it would really be."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,This is the second one of these I have owned.  This one lasted just a little over a year.  The bottom cracks and it leaks.  I did put it in the dishwasher and really don't want a baking tool that can not be put in the dishwasher.  I thought it said dishwasher safe.  Back to a glass measuring cup for me.  I have owned and used some of those for 30 years.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"Well made, as you can definitely feel it. The stainless steel feel and the rubber is great.
The cold and heat control maintainenance is great so far.

1 star off for the cap. The lock creates a great seal, BUT it is a pain to get it open. There is no way I can open this while driving with one hand.
I have the older contigo with the press and open. That was much more convenient.

Click help if this review helped."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"It sets up lopsided so that only one of the little sticks that is supposed to hit the bell is actualy dinging the bell.  The other one always misses unless you give the spin a push and make the little sticks fly out more.  I've tried coaxing/bending it this way or that, since it is oh so thin, but nothing fixes the issue.  Try different manufacturer.  Chinsy crap that didn't work right.  Not recommended."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"This knife is bulky and heavy and not in a good way.  The blade on this knife is really thick and the ""sharpened end"" is pretty dull.  I sharpened it myself and it cuts well, but because it is so heavy it is hard to maneuver or get nice thin cuts of anything.  Even sharpened you have to basically pry an onion open to cut it.  This is definitely not a professional knife by any means."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,It is not twistable after being in the freezer. I always have to put it under tap water for a while before I can twist it. Sometimes I use a grinder to grind out some parsley. Sometimes I just shave off some using a knife. But I always wonder whether I am shaving off some plastic off the container. The container is really small. It will probably take 3 or more containers to fit a normal size bunch of parsley.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"I was quite disappointed in this. The picture of the comforter and pillow covers is what I excepted to get.
Instead you get a large cover for your comforter to go into. It is very soft but thin. It is not a comforter as shown in the picture. You also get 2 pillow covers. I also thought I was getting gray and I got all white. I did get this at a reduced rate but I would not purchase this again."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"I had high hopes for this set. I was looking for something a little less scary than stainless, and have heard some good things. After one use on the stovetop the bottom of the pan on the outside began to wear off and became sticky. I sent back ASAP. Not sure if I got a faulty pan but I didn't want to take any chances. Received a full refund and purchased a SS set and will never go back. Good luck."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"This stopper does not work at all. My plumber had to change out my drain to run and he put in a pop up. The previous one I had picked up all of our hair and it worked well so I knew how much hair comes off our heads in just a few days. With this catcher, it might catch 4-5 hair stands in a few days. And while showering I end up standing in 2 inches of water."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"There are a LOT of pieces to this dresser. Many, many more than I expected. Most are poorly labelled. I spent 6 hours working on this thing and the drawers don't line up, so I can't close my top drawers.

I am so disappointed. I have spent so much time trying to put this together. I will have to get someone to drill new hole to lower the rails for the top row. I can't believe after all of this that it doesn't work!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"The side fabric is soft and pretty, thicker and better than the cheaper plain white vinyl models.
The compartments are way too big for my wine glasses tho.
This would work well for balloon wine glasses or any large and wide stem, but it is much too big for smaller european-size white wine stems.
The dividing cardboard is loose and floppy. Unless you fill up each compartment, it will flex/collapse and allow your glasses to bang together.
I ended up using the container for wide mouth beer glasses."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,Too much trouble putting up this film.  Followed Instructions but still could not take out the bubbles and wrinkles.  Worked on it over and over and still not so great.  The film would block the heat and sun okay but the trouble of putting it up and trying to make it look half way decent was not worth the trouble.  I need to find something else for my storm door and windows because of the frustration of putting up the film.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"If you pay attention to the type and cut of the blade. If you look at this tool closely, you will notice that it sharpens all blades the same way, but not all garden tools have the same style blade. Also, given that garden tools have heavier tougher blades, this tool does sometimes loosen up during rigorous sharpening. I use a handheld stone to clean up the blade a bit before using this sharpener. But, for the price and convenience it's a reasonable tool sharpener."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"Apparently, from the reviews and images posted for this product, not everyone is receiving the same product.  I received two ""Crucial Vacuum"" branded filters when I ordered this item (Bissell HEPA Media Filter, 32076).

As noted in the review of the Crucial filters,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bissell-Style-7-Style-9-HEPA-Media-Filter-Compare-to-Bissell-Part-32076/dp/B003C0FH0I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bissell Style 7, Style 9 HEPA Media Filter; Compare to Bissell Part#32076</a>, these filters are notably short (~1.8mm).  Numerically, this may seem like a small difference in tolerances, but it allows a significant amount of air leakage through these gaps."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"As many other reviewers have said, one of the corners did not inflate all the way. It is still compressed to 6"" on that side. The rest of the mattress did end up being about 11"" tall. I waited a full 72 hours before even sitting on the mattress. This mattress collects and generates an incredible amount of heat. I will wake up sweaty directly where my body is touching it. Overall the firmness is fine and it is comfortable. But is defective and too hot."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"Sloppy fit between the jug and the electric motor, necessating having to hold on to the whole thing with both hands when I turned it on. Poor seal between the Jar and the cap caused a spillage mess. No variable rheostat so I couldn't start slowly and avoid a jump of the liquid in the jar. I believe the next time I go to the rifle range I'll take this thing with me so I can have the satisfaction of killing it."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"I had a cute little apple timer like this in college, so I ordered this one as well. When it arrived I stuck it next to my oven. I tried baking a pizza the very next day, setting the timer as usual , but it didn't go off. It made the ticking sound but didn't ring when the time was up. Low and behold, another burnt pizza, because I was waiting for my timer to go off. So disappointing, because it was a really cute timer. I returned it."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"It didn't juice very well, after just one apple the mesh cutter on the inside got filled with apple and didn't juice until I cleaned it out.  And not to mention it didn't get a whole lot of juice out anyway what i did get was an apple shake. Seemed like a hassle to have to juice something then take it apart and clean it just to continue. N by the time I finished cleaning it out the juice that I did get looked awful and tasted awful."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"Put me down as another person receiving a defective unit. First, the machine never cooled past -7F on ""pre-cool"". Second, on the first and second batches (I didn't make any more), after the ""add mix-ins"" alert and mix-ins are added (not many, and not large pieces), the machine sounds like a motorcycle revving in the kitchen non-stop and the paddle stops turning. The ice cream was alternating between ""frozen yogurt"" and ""gelato"" on the display, actually reversing back down a couple of times. I'm trying one more time before buying a different brand."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"I really wantes to like these...and was excited for meal prep. I received the package quickly HOWEVER I am extremely disappointed. I paid $17.95 after reading reviews saying these were sturdy containers...one of mine came broken. Keep in mind there are six, I have not used them..I took them out and washed them with lukewarm water and soap and got to the last bottom container and it was BROKEN. This is ridiculous for having paid so much money. ..I was better off with the cheaper kind for 8 bucks. I want a replacement!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"THIS IS A VERY HANDY DEVICE,  WE RANCH AND TRACK IN BITS OF HAY, GRASS AND DIRT AND GRAVEL, I JUST GRAB THE LINX AND IT PICK UP EVERYTHING BUT THE LARGER PIECES OF GRAVEL.  NO CORD TO PLUG IN.  BATTERY LIFE IS ADEQUATE FOR OUR SMALL JOB CLEANING, AS I BOUGHT A SPARE.  I GAVE IT THREE STARS BECAUSE THE DUST BIN OCASIONALY FALLS OUT,  IT DOESN'T SPILL, JUST FALLS OUT.  A DESIGN ERROR THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN FIXED BY NOW.  IT IS VERY EASY TO EMPTY."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"Dropping to 3 stars as it is not really ""non slip"", the white dots are not scratchy whatever to keep you in place, they are just deeper pieces of plastic.... Definitely not a step stool you want to use if you are actually wet, like out of the swimming pool or bathtub wet... unfortunately it took a fall for us to look at it a little closer and see they were not slip grip things.

Is still a great stool, just not safe non slip.... it is super sturdy and easy to use, just stay dry"

This machine can me great ice cream and sherbet. More fat-content (heavy cream, instead of skim milk) will bring creamier results. But to bring the calories down, I combine 1.25 cups of half-and-half and 1 cup of skim milk.

Yes, it can make loud noise too! See the video. I place the machine in the basement so it won't bother me and the neighbor."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"I'm glad these were cheap or I would have been royally mad.  First of all, the material these sheets are made off is horrible.  They are slippery so my son wakes up every morning with the comforter on the floor and the sheets almost off the bed.
Also, the picture is very deceiving.  The sheets are black, and the only colorful thing is the pillow.  My son is 7...I'm not sure black sheets are what he wanted.
I bought my other son a set of Batman sheets at Wal-mart which were cheaper and better quality."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"This is very good product at an exceptional price.  The thing that bothers me though is that it often seems to fry the foods at the ridges instead of grill.  In turn, there is an appearance of grilling but a fried texture.  This may be due to the width of the ridges and the non-stick coating.  However, I think this is common to all makes of these pans.  Face it, nothing beats a true grill.  Nice to have this when it is raining or just too cold to fire up the BBQ."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"I bought it because the stainless steel would hold far fewer bacteria than a plastic turkey baster. However, this doesn't hold suction well.  Liquid (wine in this case) doesn't just drip out... It RUNS out.  I am able to work around it by quickly tilting it back to retain some liquid.  I wanted to try to avoid using a glass thief as it would probably be broken by my clumsiness. I see there are plastic thiefs out.  Guess I will just have to get one and replace them from time to time to avoid contaminants."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"Do not believe the ""highlights"" - these are the roughest pillow cases I have ever had.  Plus, they are no larger than the ""regular' ones that come with sheet sets.  I bought them based on the reviews and that they were supposed to be larger and soft...they are neither.

I am a little shocked because the reviews were so good.  Do keep in mind I am highly sensitive and perhaps a ""normal"" person would think these are soft...but size...I laid them out on top of the other pillow cases I own and there is no difference at all."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"Much paler than the photo and different shade.  Very light and more grey, I'd call it pale lavender.  Also it's 100% polyester.  If you read the package CAREFULLY it does IMPLY same quality as Egyptian cotton and lower states microfiber, doesn't exactly come out and say polyester.  Misleading product information.  They're ok for what I paid but I would have preferred that the product information clearly stated what it is.  Also wrinkles.  After initial laundering, original shipping wrinkles present as well as new ones from washing.  I removed from the dryer promptly."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"I've cooked professionally for a good many years and know slicers. I wasn't expecting too much with this slicer but wow, the noise it made. In addition, the blade moved very slowly. I could see the screws rotate around. I shouldn't see that. I called Weston and they took a message to call back. So at present, unless they send me one that doesn't sound like I turned on a leaf blower and has a blade that has a higher rpm, I'm getting my money back. I hope it is just a defective machine, because the rest of it is fine."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"It leaks, it leaks!

Dang.

My office chair, which gets heavily used, would settle slowly towards the earth in the course of a day. And then need to be raised again. So I replaced the cylinder with this one with this one. Removing the old cylinder just took one good whack, then installing this one was easy, everything fit nicely.

Unfortunately... my chair is still settling slowly towards the earth. Not as fast. But still doing it.

Oh well.

I will try again with a different manufacturer. I will modify this review if it turns out that it's somehow the chair's fault, rather than the piston's fault."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"I purchased this for my sons graduation party. With Cupcakes being ""all the rage"" now I was excited to have them professionally baked and then displayed on this 4 tier stand. Well, clearly this stand is made for miniature cupcakes. I looked at sooo many stands and really hoped this would have worked. We tried adjusting the individual holders, but no luck.  Sadly we were not able to use it. Maybe you could display 12 cupcakes by placing one on every OTHER holder.
I hope the seller would be generous enough to allow me to return this since it was not used."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"Original review: 5 stars.
Current review: 2 stars.
I bought a Gotham along with this one and tried them simultaneously. The Gotham was a disaster, everything stuck to it and cooked unevenly. This Copper Chef has been fantastic! It even cooks better WITHOUT oil!!! I haven't cooked much but the little I have has been wonderful. It is still new and I will update as I use it more. So far so good.

UPDATE: I rushed leaving my review... As I said, it had worked wonderfully until... I kept using it.  Now EVERYTHING sticks to it.  Disappointed and I apologize for the misleading review."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,At first glance the esthetics of these pans are impressive.  However my use of the smaller frying pan twice left me with a yellowing pan.  I have purchased much cheaper pans that did not change once used for. Cooking.  Surely the manufacturer understood that these pans would be used at high temps etc and the appearance should not change after two uses.  Also the instructions said to wash before use and oil. I did so with canola oil and it is struck on the sides.  Also the food that I cooked stuck to the pan during the first use.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"I wanted to love this set, I really did. It looked great the minute I put it out of the bag and onto my bed. However, after the first round through the washing machine (they do get dirty you know). it lost its shape and it no longer was the comforter that I wanted on my bed for it wouldn't lay flat. It had places where the batting would be bunched up and places where it would just be the outer material. It looked cheap and I ended up giving it to my dogs to lay on in the garage."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"This was a good idea unfortunately it is made with cheap metal, the shelves all bend in the center under the weight of the lightest pasta box. Forget about being able to store anything like cans or jars, not gonna happen. I would also like to add that DBRoth company has the worst business sense ever. The seller did not respond to my request to return till it was too late, then I was told they would grant me a partial refund so I sent the item back at my expense and it's been over three months later and I have not received a refund."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"Update Nov. 10.2015: This thing sucks, totally inaccurate. I started measuring against known weights (thanks metric system) and it is wildly unreliable. Adding small measures of water to a container does not show up consistently, so you will see a jump every 50-100 grams while slowly adding something. Downgraded from 2 stars to 1 star.

I like the style and apparent built quality, the glass top makes it very easy the clean in the kitchen.

Unfortunately, it is wildly inaccurate at the gram-scale, and unreliable at ounce-scale, and only useful for lbs/kgs. I am past the return period and will be chucking it to buy another brand."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"I wasn't really pleased with the SpaceSaver. My husband and I tried several times to keep the air from coming out of the bags. I did exactly what it says on the directions. Put the items in the bag, zip up the top very secure, suck the air out of the bag with a vaccum, put the cap back on very tightly. I then listened for any air coming out of the top and out of the cap and didn't hear anything. However, the air seems to always come out of the bags either overnight or after a few days. I found it to be useless."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"The 2 pack Standard pillows are TERRIBLE! First of all, they are not the same as the Queen sized. I purchased 2 of the queen pillows and I am VERY pleased with them. So much, that I decided to buy some standard size for our guest room. Instead of buying the Standard size, I went for the 2 pack deal. To my surprise they are NOT THE SAME! They were packed, jammed packed, into a small postal service box. BURSTING at the seams!! After taking them out, I noticed they are super flat, and barely any down alternative filling in them. DO NOT BUY the 2 pack Standard pillows!!!!!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"I bought the 20-piece set as a trial, along with some Wallace flatware that cost a bit more.
I would say these are an OK value for the price.  They are attractive though I wish the contrast were a bit more.
The Wallace pieces are heavier and have 18-10 stainlesss, meaning they have 8%-10%  nickel which gives them shine and means they are less likely to rust.

I do like the design and I'd keep these if I didn't have the money to buy better flatware, and they could replace some cheap pieces I already own.
But as it is I just gave these to a friend who needs some flatware."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,It does a good job of filtering the water but even a new filter is so slow! And you have to fill the upper container twice to get it to 2/3rds full. Don't fill it any farther or it won't filter the rest that's in the upper part. It just sits there. When you try to pour it the unfiltered water in the upper part is what comes out first. The upper container needs to be bigger. I think they made it that way so you can try their filter out and then go out and buy their filter that attaches to your faucet like I ended up doing.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"It is my second Primula Espresso Coffee Maker. I should say that the quality went down significantly. The previous one had rubber gasket between upper and lower parts, this one has cheap plastic stuff which leaks when you pour the hot coffee. It is very unpleasant experience. Top portion of the maker has also deteriorated from the previous model. Hadn't I trashed the original box, I would have returned the maker after the very first use.

Ordered a rubber gasket to replace the original plastic one.

Update: the maker was returned as the quality of the product was below expectations. Rate was changed from 2 stars to 1. Not recommended for purchase."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"Really cute in theory. But as others mentioned no instructions came with it and it didn't fit together well in any manner I tried. As time was running out I had no option but to use it but it was very wobbly/unbalanced in the only way I could get it together, and I had to rig a way to make it stand somewhat straight by tying plastic strips tightly around the bottom stem. I don't know why the manufacturer doesn't correct these flaws numerous people have informed them of since it is a really pretty design. Just makes you think they don't care, and if they don't why should anyone else?"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"I bought this (not on Amazon) to replace a Cuisinart CPT-180 which I moved to my 2nd home in FL, and still works well. I too bought it for the retro look (as I did the Cuisinart) but looks aren't everything. It toasts much slower than its predecessor. If I read an expert review right, the light/dark knob controls a timer rather than a toast sensor, which means no consistency between say white or wheat bread, etc.

On the plus side, I have used it for 18 months with no problems other than the slow toasting. And the slots will take large bagel halves. But I'm done with it. Ordering the Cuisinart CPT-180 today."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"These are terrible for scooping icecream. I think its because the slider piece is not close enough to the scoop... the icecream gets stuck & the scoop gets stuck out, so you must have super human strength to squeeze open or close  the handle & even then, the icecream doesn't come out.  I have tried soaking in hot water & it just makes a mess of melted icecream. These Look like the real thing (there are some that look like these that are much better quality!)  I used the smaller one for cookie dough & that one actually works quite well. Maybe I got a dud on the big one."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"If you can lift furniture high enough to get this product under it, you can lift it high enough to put a furniture slider under it.  I guess if you have some furniture that has a lip on it...  I found it worthless for the furniture I was trying to move.  I am a 49 yr of female who was helping my parents (mid to late 70s) move some office furniture in order to paint a room.  Since there was no lip, I just barely lifted the furniture enough for them to slide a furniture sliders underneath each corner.  I returned this for refund- it was useless to me."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"I purchased this for my new loveseat. Its add says ""fits most loveseats"" . I would argue that. The cover is quite small and barely covers 3/4 of the seating area. It would fit a mini couch, or a overstuffed chair but not a standard loveseat. The microfiber cloth is very thin too. One of the selling points which attracted me to the cover was its elastic back supportive strap, well the strap was so short I couldn't stretch the strap over the couch's back so I just cut if off.  I probably would have returned it but it was worth my time and the price of the product. I would not recommend."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"I soooo wanted to like this item, due to its nice looking design and how it stopped my memory foam from slipping! The design is the only reason why I have given two stars and not one.

Heres the deal breaker: this cool gel cover is like an extreme HEATING PAD! After I completed assembly necessary to sleep in my new bed, I was in need of a nap because I was exhausted. My nap was interrupted by the constant sensation of feeling as if I was about to erupt in flames.  This product TRAPS AND STORES HEAT! I had to end my nap in order to avoid becoming a sweaty mess during the day."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"We use on the door that goes to the garage to keep hats and mittens in and on the door of our baby girls' room to keep her little matching outfits in.  I like that the pockets are mesh in case items that are damp are place in there so that they can dry.  I don't see much of a point to the double pocket.  The hangers that came with it are useless as they do not fit over ANY door that is in our house.  I ended up spending about as much money on 3M command hooks to hang it as I did on the organizer itself, but it works."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"Functions reasonably well and so far accurate at temperature readings with ~3 months of weekly use.  The low rating is for the ridiculously complex and counter-intuitive programing which renders it essentially useless beyond the basic function of telling the temperature remotely. I just built a pc and found it easier than trying to operate this unit.  In addition, it's very difficult to read the numbers on the face unless you pick up the unit and press the light button.  This is about the 4th different remote thermometer that I have tried and all have problems, not sure where to find one with the combination or reliability, intuitive programming, easy to read data."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"I purchased this and an American Expedition coffee mug for myself. I was shocked to discover that both of these products are actually made in China (along with everything else that ""American"" Expedition sells, as far as I can tell).

Functionally the mug works fine, and the artwork is attractive. I paid a little more for this than I normally would for a similar mug thinking I was getting something special, but other than the artwork it is just a cheap travel mug.

The words ""America"" and ""American"" appear about a dozen times on the packaging, along with words like ""authentic"" and ""pride."" Apparently American Expedition takes pride in America, just not enough to have their products made here."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"Other than that, what's there to complain about?
The new version of the product has a plastic sleeve that gives a more accurate temperature reading but why care when it takes all day to chill the bottle of white? It is unbelievably noisy when operating and couldn't possibly be used any place you want to have a conversation. If you put your white wine in the refrigerator to bring it close to serving temp and then put it in the chiller it might work to your advantage (the unit won't be on very long) but this thing is not worth whatever you're going to pay for it. BTW, there's now a 2-bottle version. It doesn't work any better."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"I thought this was pretty great when I got it. But I have reconsidered. Stick blender cracked shortly after I got it, although it still worked. It has a (horrendous - for me) protective cover over the blades which is often in the way. The stick part really needs to be put in the dishwasher to clean it. I think that the problem is that it does too many things, and lacks the simplicity of a standard sort of stick blender. Also, the 'stick' attaches awkwardly to the motor. Mine just broke. The old standard one which I gave away worked forever.

OTOH, it is powerful, and if you don't mind the hooded blades might be just the thing."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,This clock is a really fun idea. The numbers do show up on the wall or ceiling as advertised. The color matched exactly as it shows. I think the most surprising thing about this clock was the fact that the protection only stays on for a short period of time. Perhaps even only 60 seconds then shuts off. Also it ruins strictly off of batteries. No wall plug provided. One thing I found interesting was if the table on which the clock is sitting is bumped the protection then turns on as well. Otherwise my 10 year old daughter really does enjoy the clock. She was extremely excited about it and I wouldn't say any of the features really disappointed her.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"As other reviewers have noted, the flange holding the foil cutter is highly susceptible to breaking.  Before I even used my device to open a bottle of wine, one of those flanges had broken off and the foil cutter would no longer stay in place on top of the opener. There is clearly a design flaw here. I didn't even bother to try opening a bottle after that.  Incidentally, the instructions accompanying this opener warned that it might not be able to remove some corks, so it would probably be a good idea to hold onto your old corkscrew.

Update 12/14/2010.  This was my first experience returning a purchase to Amazon.  The process was painless, and the refund was quick."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"The immersion blender itself is quite nice.  I like the adjustable speed - you can use a lower speed when blending in a smaller vessel.  But the accessories are terrible.  My plastic beaker leaks.  I know - hard to imagine a plastic beaker leaking, but sure enough this one drips out the bottom.  And the chopper attachment has no bearings there so it makes a shrieking sound when it runs.  I suppose it'll probably be quieter if you chop oily foods, but i was mixing dry ingredients.  I was actually trying to grind spices and found the blade too dull for that.  Probably not what it's meant for, so i can't blame the tool for that one."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"I purchased this in an attempt to help my wife (who has chronic neck pain) have more support in the car.  She tried it and liked it the first couple trips, but then it was ""conveniently"" left at home after that.  She acted like she forgot it until I noticed it was in the living room ottoman hidden a couple months later.  She said it was kinda bulky and it made her hot and sweaty.  It did help her neck, but she felt a little claustrophobic with it on so she went back to wadding up a pillow.  I rated it a 3 because it did work, when used.  My wife just didn't like it enough to keep using it."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"Just ok.  It takes a lot of cutting to really chop a salad and it has a tendency to bruise spinach.  I suspect the double  mezzalunas would do a better job of chopping, however, I read that the food would get stuck in between the blades and I could see that.  You would need to have blades that were spread further apart than I could find to solves that problem.  I read complaints on the cover however, I have no problem with the cover.  I haven't attempted to sharpen it yet so I'm a little concerned about that.  However, it still beats hand chopping so I still recommend it if you like to chop your veggies for a sald."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"It makes great popcorn. It's fairly fast. It doesn't require a lot of oil.

But as some others have noted, the plastic cover is fragile. Drop it once, or even bump it hard, and it will crack. Attempts to glue mine back together have not been very successful. One source for a replacement dome charges $23; the current price of a whole new unit is $29.

For being cheap in the design and unreasonable about the replacement part cost, they get kicked down from 5 stars to 3.

Adequate to the task if you are gentle with it. I wouldn't recommend it for a house full of children, though.

It's a pity they didn't reinforce the rim; that's all it would have taken to make this a great little unit."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"This mister was not as advertised.  Even the instructions had misspelled and/or missing words.  The tubing was hard plastic and was difficult to work with.  After I finally attached the tubing to my floor fan with the tiny zip ties furnished, I screwed in the ""nozzles"" and secured my water hose to the inlet and turned the water on.  The nozzles were a screw-in type and were cheaply made because they leaked.  I tried every water pressure possible to try to make this work, but the nozzles either ""spit"" or dripped and soaked everything in front of the fan.  The promise of the ""mist evaporating and leaving only cool air"" was totally false.  I would not recommend this product to anyone!!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"These pillows were no better than the cheap $5 pillows you can find at any low-rent discount bricks-and-mortar store.  Since the Dream Supreme pillow set cost far more than $5, I am extremely disappointed, and I've initiated a return and refund request with Amazon.

There is absolutely no neck or head support - those cheap pillows they give you on airplanes provide more support than these alleged Dream Supreme pillows. I woke up with a hideous neck-ache, which is not something I've ever experienced before.  Don't waste a dime of your hard-earned money buying these cheap junk pillows with a fancy expensive-sounding alias.  They're j-u-n-k.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"This is my second Cuisinart hand blender in this model (I sadly left the older model in Texas with a friend) and I am incredibly disappointed in the new ""feature"" of having to hold down the speed button and then, USING ANOTHER HAND, press the ""lock"" button. It's not like the lock button is in an easy to reach place with one's fingers...nope, it's right at the top of the device, making it impossible to safely reach around, up, or over with the same hand, thus rendering this once single-hand device useless as a single-hand device.
You really hosed this one, Cuisinart, and it's probably because you had to because some twat stuck their finger in the blades at one time, so now the rest of us suffer thanks to idiots."

Today, August 7th, 2017, one of the Bormioli Rocco glasses exploded spontaneously inside the dishwasher while it was OFF.
The glass was dirty and I was waiting to get more dishes to run the dishwasher. I'm totally surprised that this happened.

I'm lucky that it exploded while inside the dishwasher (minimizing broken glass all over). I don't think I will buy these glasses again as EXPLODING GLASSES are too dangerous to have around my family.

Do not buy them unless you want to risk yourself and your loved ones with them."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"Loved the way the pillow looked, and I was impressed with how hefty a pillow it is- definitely not a flimsy one. However, the fabric on the front is really scratchy, so if you want people to put their faces or bare skin on this, I would think twice.

Update: Did anyone ask for an update on this throw pillow? Who can know. But I wanted to say that this pillow is so scratchy that it is pretty much unusable and I'm probably going to get rid of it. I am angry at the pillow but in a larger sense I am angry at myself for letting me underestimate my

Takes some thinking to put together, took about 1.5 hours.  Heavy unit.  Nice cover to cover up the mistake.
If I had a factory job putting these in boxes to send to my trading partner, I would hang my head low.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"Basically this trap is a piece of folded cardboard with a sticky patch of goo on one side. You tear open a small plastic pouch to take out a little piece of white paper which is coated in the attractant, and drop it onto the sticky patch. The moths are supposed to fly into this little triangle area the size of a small slice of pie in search of the smell, and get stuck to the one sticky side. I guess it really depends on the types of moths you have floating around your house. We have the really tiny ones that come in from outside during spring and summer in California, and this didn't catch any of them. Hopefully that means they are not the type of moths that eat clothes."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"I purchased this in blue to put under my dining room table to protect the wood floors. While I don't have a problem with the quality so far, there is this awful stench coming from the rug. It smells like chemicals. I thought the smell would dissipate after a few days.. I was wrong. Also, if you have pets you can see just about every bit of hair on it. I wished I wouldn't of purchased this but it's too late. Not absolutely horrible- just not for me.

***UPDATE 6/1/16***
I am truly regretting this rug especially in this color!! . Every little speck of dust and animal hair and shows up and it always looks dirty even after I vacuum it. I have a great vacuum so I definitly know that's not the problem."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"This paper towel stand is sturdy but light.  The decorative design dresses your paper towel roll up just a bit in your kitchen.  It's a fine product and offered at a fair price.

UPDATE 11/3/15: Dropping this down to two stars.  After only a few months of ownership the simple soldering joints where the vertical poles attach to the base broke.  This holder is decorative.  However, it is cheaply assembled and quality control missed the mark on this one.  We'll be looking elsewhere for a replacement.  The brand is fine, but this model is flimsy and weak."

The bands are challenging to stretch over the mattress far enough so that when you pull the opposite side to do that band the other end pulls up from the opposite side- not all the way off, but it still is a back and forth. Today after 2 months of use one of the elastic corner bands came apart from the mattress pad. It already broke and I've only taken it off the bed 3 times. A total waste of money. Get the kind that is like a sheet and goes all the way down. I was hoping I could return these and get my money back but my return window closed 2 weeks ago. One of them has never even been out of the package."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"It grinds. That is about the best I can say about it. I bought this in April 2017.

To get it to grind, I have to constantly shake the unit while grinding so that the blades are grinding coffee beans versus air. The dial is so loose for the grind grading, that just touching it could shift it. Same with the timer. Don't accidentally touch it because the time will shift. Finally, there is ground coffee all over the counter-top every day because the cup is so static that there is coffee in and out of the cup. I don't usually write reviews much, much less bad one. But this was a waste of money.

I think I'll go back to the Breville we had for a few years (which ironically had worse reviews than this one!)."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"Item came packaged well but it's certainly not high end quality stuff. It works well in the space, for now at least. Very lightweight so I was able to hang using just the adhesive plastic wall hooks, so that's a plus. Since it's made of plastic, the edges don't sit perfectly flat when I had them laid out on my table to figure out how I wanted to hang them. But since you're hanging them on the little triangular hook in the back, it does lean forward slightly off the wall hook, so you don't really notice the edges. If you're looking to decorate a small wall and not spend too much, then it's not a bad option. Not sure I would buy again but it's decent enough to keep and looks fine in that space."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"I needed white balloons specifically for a birthday party craft.  When these arrived, I was a little concerned because they looked very yellow.  I decided to give it a try and blow one up.  They're pretty much clear balloons with a yellowish tinge and a little shine.  If I held the balloon near a book I could comfortably read through the balloon.  I don't know if I was accidentally given the wrong color but the sticker stuck to my bag claims they're white pearlized balloons.  Honestly, I don't know what I would call the color and I don't picture anybody going to a party store and voluntarily choosing this color.  They look like they should have been clear balloons with a bit of shine to them but they look aged and yellowed."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"I really liked this product at first.  I made a few pizza pies with it and it does definitely crisp the crust very quickly.  So the cheese was not burnt on top and the crust beneath was done well.  I did not have to pre-cook the crust first as I did without the stone

The reason for the one star is that after the the fourth usage it broke completely in half, when I simply lifted the stone out of the oven.  It was already a week outside of the return window because I don't make pizza at home that often.  I am not sure why it broke in half.  Perhaps the difference between the hot oven and 70 degree room temperature.

Oh well, excellent concept, but apparently poorly executed as the stone was too fragile."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"I owned a memory foam pillow prior to purchasing this one and I love it.  I am older and have a problem with night sweats, so I was looking for a memory foam pillow that would stay cool.  I have to say that I am a little disappointed.  I don't see much difference between this pillow and the pillow that I had, as far as being cooler. In addition this pillow is not as soft and flexible as my first one and I assume that is because of the gel.  If you toss and turn a lot like I do, or suffer from night sweats, this is probably not for you.  However, the price is very reasonable compared to others.  My first pillow was $65, so the quality of that pillow was possibly better."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"It's an okay water pump for me but my wife doesn't really like it. The reason is when she presses the top it gets stuck and by the time she gets it unstuck, the pump has lost the vacuum pressure. She suffers from carpal tunnel so the amount of force required exceeds what she can apply sometimes.
I've seen it the way she uses the pump and I realized that it does required rapid force applied correctly at the pump. If you apply force say at one side then the pump gets stuck.
Another example was from my parents trying to press the pump with their fingers instead of the palm of the hand, I always have to remind them to use the palm.
Update: it has started to squeak when pressed down, bummer I thought this would last longer. Down to two stars."

I would not suggest people waste their money on these honestly.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"I over all like Panasonic products a lot and have been happy with them. This rice cooker is, however, different. The flawed design is that this one does not have an holder to collect the steam water that runs off the cover when you open the cooker. The water just collect at the rim on the edge. When water is too much or you do not give it time to evaporate on its own, it drains down. One of the danger is that it drains down to the electric socket located at the bottom of the cooker. I returned it because of this poor design, it can cause a short circuit. Please note that not every time the water will drain down that far or it will drain into the socket head on, but for me it is too much a chance to take."

I would not recommend this product if you looking to cut a sweet potatoe. The suction to keep it in place did not work and it was uncomfortably placed.  The sweet potatoes when I finally got it to cut went flying out of the contraption.  In the video you see the suction come back up so I have to hold it down.  Then you see how much pressure it takes me to get the sweet potato though and it never makes it the last little bit so everything go flying out over and into the sink.  Ugh."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"These heavy duty, kitchen scissors have many functions but if you have arthritis in your fingers the handles are a wee bit too tight. And, I was surprised that the scissors aren't quite sharp enough. The scissors come with a magnetic sheath which I attach to the side of my refrigerator. However, the magnet isn't quite strong enough & when I put the scissors in, everything slides down a little bit then stops. Because the magnet isn't strong enough, it works better on the side of the fridge rather than on the door where opening/closing the door constantly jars it. **The scissors have many functions:
They come apart & can be used separately for slicing. At the top of one handle is a bottle opener. The top of the other handle can be used as a screw driver. With the blades joined you can open jar lids or crack nuts between the handles. One blade doubles as a vegetable peeler. The other blade's serrated edge can be used to scale fish."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"The price is the key here. I bought these a month ago and finally got to use them. The bags are a little bit ""slipperier"" if that makes sense and the roll doesn't fit in the area meant for bags. I knew this prior to purchase.... but it is inconvenient to cut them by hand. I guess I will roll some out so they do fit. I would recommend though without question for the price alone!

*****Updated Review***** These are horrible. Do NOT buy them! Here I am months later and realizing that the cheap imitations don't last. You seal your food. It looks fine/like it worked. And then either weeks or a couple months after you open your freezer to get something out and realize that the vacuum seal did not hold. I resealed at least 10 packages yesterday that I noticed had a gap/room inside. One package actually had freezer burn. So in the long run this item was DEFINITELY NOT worth it!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"A month after I purchased this I gave it 4 stars.  Today I will give it only one.

The pan is great, a bit tinny so it warps easily but pretty good.  The problem: The rack in NOT Stainles and ""rots.""  See photo.

You can see corrosion from chicken and pork?  See exposed copper which was used as an inter-plating before chrome plating.  Now regular steel wire costs about $1/lb and Stainless Steel costs about $2/lb.  Therefore, for being miserly, by not using good materials two things happen: 1) In ordinary use the plating breaks off meaning you may be ingesting both chrome and copper (ingesting iron won't hurt you, and actually the copper won't either, but I don't really know about chrome.  C'mon Manufactuer spend $1 more and raise the price $2 and give me a pan WITH A RACK that lasts.  The manufacturer says stainless steel pan so is semi-honest and so gets one star.  I'm disappointed."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"I purchased a reconditioned Salton EX 122 about a month ago. I thought I'd be getting a great deal, since my previous experience with reconditioned / refurbished products has been uniformly good. Not so here. The coffee maker came missing several parts, including the espresso carafe and the metal filter basket. Foolishly, I decided that it wasn't worth returning the whole item to Amazon for these two small parts, but as it turned out, these two small parts were impossible to find online. I eventually managed a partial solution, but then I encountered a much bigger challenge (at least when it comes to enjoying a nice cappuccino). On other machines I've had, the steam pressure could be directed either toward the filter basket or into the milk frother. Not so here. The steam isn't emitted through the frothing tube until practically the end of the process. So, great espresso but crappy cappuccino because the milk never gets warm and never gets frothy.

The coffee maker works great, though."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"I purchased this at Bed Bath and Beyond 15 months ago. It squeegees the glass very well, and the suction cup fixture stays up. (It detached just once, in the seasonal change from humid to dry weather.) No rust, and the rubber blade has stayed flexible. The folding design keeps the squeegee off to the side, out of sight.

Yet, I'm unhappy: the folding pivot point has loosened over these 15 months. If it was just a bit ""wiggly,"" that might be okay. However, the pivot and its fold-lock mechanism are obviously parting ways. The squeegee is no longer effective because the blade cannot be held perpendicular at the end of the swiveling handle.

My experience with this squeegee is similar to other ""simplehuman"" products I've used in the past. They look well-designed, with an aesthetic similar to Oxo and other neo-design products. But, their engineering has invariably incorporated flaws that eventually destroy the product's usefulness. I'll be replacing this squeegee with one from another manufacturer, and not purchasing from this line again."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,I am disappointed in these to be honest.  I liked them... LOVED them actually.  I put them in some sconces I have on my bedroom walls.  A little ambient light in the evening while I'm closing up the house and going to bed.. and a little romantic lighting as well.  They worked on the timer for about a month.  I got them on March 8th.  Put them up on the 10th and here is it April 12 and they have been dark for 2 days already some a week.  The batteries are supposed to last for over 200 hours.. I got maybe 180 lite hours out of them.  Really disappointing.  I guess they would last longer if I would have just used the remote every night but that was what the time was supposed to be for.  I guess I will just leave them in for now as decoration.  I am not going to spend 5.00 a month on batteries for them.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"I loved this cooker, but it inexplicably went dead in the middle of a cycle after just two years of light use.  Given the cost of the item, I am not pleased.  Worse, this failure occurred abruptly after a spendy repair to the steam valve.

Before the failure, I found the device to make reliable rice and risotto. Having perfectly cooked rice in six minutes is definitely a luxury. The browning function made the slow cook feature very convenient- we made several pot roasts and a lot of pulled pork in this.  It was also nice to be able to use the pressure setting as a sort of turbocharge for the slow cooker if things were dragging.

That said, the short shelf life is not the cooker's only failing.  The gasket is fiddly and doesn't always seal properly.  Dirt tends to collect in crevices and it can be difficult to clean.  Finally, the steam valve inexplicably shattered one day, and judging from the other reviews here, this is not an uncommon occurrence."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"I am changing my review (shown below). This item is poorly made. After wearing to sleep at night over a 2 week period, it sprung a major leak. I awoke to find my head covered in little white beads. I contacted and returned to Amazon. They sent me another. After 2 weeks, this one is starting to leak. The inner lining is a very poor thin cloth which does not last. Also, the side holes serve no purpose in a wrap around sleep mask.

Unlike some reviews, this is a serious review. It is very comfortable and fits completely over the head. There is a hole in front which will fit leaving my nose and mouth uncovered but covering my eyes. it does reduce sound but does not completely eliminate it. It is not hot. It does not require any straps  for adjustment. Simply pull it on and adjust so that the eyes are covered leaving the mouth and nose open. I can sleep comfortably on my side or back. it comes with a cloth bag for storage."

Then I use more 4 letter words. Aimed directly at the makers of this piece of crap. I am going to buy a replacement coffee machine and this one is not broken. I have never done that before. I usually just rough it and pray the inferior product just breaks.  But I hate this coffee maker so much. Its like some kind of evil torturing device for the really tired. I'll give it 2 stars instead of one only because it does actually make decent coffee if you line up the coffee basket properly.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"I had such high hopes for this chair.  I'm suffering from a minor sciatica pain and I had hoped that a chair like this that would relieve lymphatic vessels around hips would help.  But this one did not.  I couldn't find a comfortable position.  After only using it for a few hours, my shins were slightly bruised! (Purple veins were apparent)  I tried not to put too much weight on the knees/shins, but then my pelvic bones were in pain like I was on a bicycle for hours.  So I would put my weight back on my knees/shins, but then I would have pain in my shin - not so much in the knees.  I decided I couldn't work like this for 8-10 hours a day, 5 days a week.  So only after a few hours of use, this item is going back.  The user should be able to adjust the angles of the seat and the knee pad to fit the individual's needs.  This chair does not and that is the flaw."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"As I have been replacing all of my outdated appliances, both small and large, with newer, faster, fancier models, I thought that this replacement for my 25-year old toaster would be ""the bomb"".

 Unfortunately I was to be disappointed. The ""forward-facing"" slots are convenient, and the little lever that allows you to lift your toast out when it is done are well-designed. The toaster sensitivity buttons allow for a range of settings (burnt-just warmed). There is a button for ""thawing"" but I have yet to see that it does anything other than toast the item inserted. The slots are wonderfully wide for even the largest bagel, yet accomodate regular bread well. The stay-cool to the touch outside is very nice.

 The problem? It toasts one side crispy, the other luke-warm. I find it necessary to switch slots and give it an extra few seconds (as the left slot cooks more on the right side, and the right slot cooks more on the left side).

 All in all this is just an expensive excuse for an regular toaster, and a mediocre one at that."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"I recently purchased this after picking way too many apples.  Knowing I had a lot of peeling ahead, I thought this would be a wonderful solution.
It turned out to be a complete waste of money & time.
The plastic is flimsy, the handle pops off while you are turning it, and the suction cups on the base are weak.
One of their selling points is ""the spring loaded blade peels the apple skin in one continuous motion"", but when the handle keeps popping off that means a lot of stopping & restarting.
They likely did this 'assemble at home' so it would fit into a smaller box.  Would have been well worth it to have a larger box & the handle attached to the peeler so you really could peel in one continuous motion.
The peeler does work...just not very well.  In my opinion, there are others listed here on Amazon that are better constructed and would do a much better job for just a few dollars more.  I did not realize something this simple would require researching before buying but now I know!"

I found myself like most folks on here, not sure of how to use it, as the 'cookbook' that came with it was pretty much just a few recipes. I did find a wonderful pressure cooker cookbook here on Amazon, and I would suggest you purchase something along these lines. This author has been using electric pressure cooking for years, and her book is full of helpful hints, and tons of recipes. I have found it to be invaluable. Just even in the rice section.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"Practical joke? Since day one of using this thing, I keep imagining that the Candid Camera crew is hiding somewhere in my house. This morning, for instance... I placed my container on the center of the scale and zeroed it out. I measured out 40 grams of coffee. The container shifted maybe 1/2 inch and BOOM!, there were now 43 grams of coffee. I dumped all the coffee back into its bag to start over. Now, my container, which should be back at zero, weighed 17 grams. So I zeroed it out and tried again to measure out 40 grams of coffee - still a moving target, but I just went with it. I needed coffee. NOW. OK - on to measuring out 80 grams of water for the ""bloom"": I zeroed out my kettle and over-poured by about 10 grams, so I dumped out what I thought would be 10 grams of water. BOOM! there were now 12 grams MORE than what I started with. I poured water out and the weight went up! We live in a wacky world - Floods, famine, fire, and stupid Ozeri Kitchen Scales."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"The product is good - the blades are sharp, the whole device feels solid and heavy in the hand, and it does work on meat as advertised, however, there's one significant point where the product description is false.  The product listing says that this specific model is ""Made in the USA"" and it's NOT.  The packaging on my Jaccard Super 3 clearly states ""Designed in USA. Made in China.""  So that little bit of false advertising made me deduct one star.

EDITED:  I just read the other reviews, and one reviewer pointed out that this $37 item is the exact same product as a $17 item that's being sold by another 3rd-party seller.  I actually did notice the other seller's item before I purchased mine, I just chose this one because the description says it was made in the USA.  Again, it's NOT made in the USA, it is made in China.  The seller's description is basically false advertising. And if it's the exact same item as the one that's less than half the price, then that makes THIS product at THIS price a total rip-off."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"Back when I first started leaning how to cook, I also learned I really hated peeling potatoes. Until I got one of those automatic peelers.

OK maybe it is not that revolutionary, but it is a great tool for your kitchen and it has so many more options than just peeling. You can Shred various vegetables and fruit. You can spiral cut too. You can even cut you own potato chips, at least you can if your deep fryer still works (that will be my next review).

The negatives are that it is made of rather flimsy plastic, so I don't know just how durable it will be in the long run. The storage in nice but the door does not close right due to the cheep plastic.

Overall a nice addition to your kitchen tool collection, especially if medical issues make peeling difficult for you. Also if you are a creative chef, the spiral cut and shredding options should inspire you to Iron Chef levels."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"Was hoping to get a decent cup of coffee from this machine but was disappointed. Major problem is that the water is not heated sufficiently when the coffee is brewed to deliver a hot cup of coffee when the brewing process stops. As cold tap water temperatures are somewhat cooler out of the tap in the winter I tried slightly preheating the water before placing it in the coffeemaker...no major improvement. Temperature of coffee in pot immediately after being brewed about 145 degrees.

What's interesting is that the coffee did indeed get hotter after sitting on the heating element than it was after it initially brewed. Unfortunately, we like to drink coffee immediately after it has been brewed not 30 minutes or an hour later. Our old Braun coffee pot delivered much hotter coffee.

A few minor points include the area where you pour water into the coffeemaker being a little smaller than expected,and the need to move the brew water delivery arm back and forth.

This coffee maker was bought as one of a few small things that we put under our Christmas tree to give ourselves so the 30 day return period to Amazon has past otherwise it would go back."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"I cannot say enough to warn you away from this pillow - please save your money.

My husband bought this pillow hoping it would be as stellar as its description and it falls short in every way. After 2 months of trying to make it work (because it was SO expensive), he gave up and returned to his old pillow. I then took up the cause (because it was SO expensive) and tried to make it work.
  - There is not a slant from either side that is comfortable for your neck
  - The material collapses with the weight of your head
  - No benefit to snoring
  - Not comfortable if you sleep on your back (my husband)
  - Not comfortable if you sleep on your side (me)
So after months of trying to literally make this work, I emailed about getting a return because MOST other expensive pillow companies have 1 or 5 year guarantees....not this place. They give you so many days to return it. My mistake to trust people because they are nurses. Why would nurses sell pillows?

Now we have this pillow no one likes, even our house guests have tried it and preferred other, older pillows to this one!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"My H2O mop gave out after a little better than a year; I should have taken an extended warranty as offered, but, then, how does one send the darned thing back if the original box for shipping hasn't been saved?  My problem early on was I felt the floor was so wet when I finished and took a long time to dry; I called the company and a woman I spoke with suggested going over an area with mop on and then click it off and go over the same area again without the steam being expelled.  That was fine.  But was it the frequent clicking on and off that caused the mop to eventually cease to work?  I took it to a repair place near where I live, but they could do nothing with it.  So I'm out the mop.  I've gone back instead to the Hoover Floormate, which, really, is a much better piece of equipment...and does do grout!  We have an older Florida home with terrazzo floors, and the Floormate is ideal on them, as, in a way, was the H2O mop.  But the Floormate both expels and draws up moisture.  That would be the big drawback to the mop."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"I love bamboo.  I am picky about what goes into my kitchen or, as in this case, what I give to someone else for their kitchen.  I read all the reviews (on Amazon and on other sites) about Joyce Chen and took a chance.  Big mistake.  Compared to my other bamboo utensils, these are cheap and what I would consider to be disposable.  They are not what I would call ""burnished"" by any means.  The product description uses words like ""beautiful and practical"" and ""impressive"" to describe Joyce Chen tools.  I wouldn't even think those words in connection with the utensils I received.  The surface was rough and uneven, and one item even had visible ""splinters"" on it.  It will only take a few minutes to sand them down and oil them to make decent (not wonderful) utensils, but I am disappointed that I will have to do so.  I would not want to wash these until I sand and oil them.  I think the water would get in and cause them to spit.  Of course, I ignored my own rule... you get what you pay for... and that's what I get.  Next time, I will pay more and get Totally Bamboo products."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"I got this because the office I work in is notoriously cold, and I thought it would help to keep my feet warm as cold feet was my biggest complaint while at work and that, in turn, made the rest of me cold.

Anyway, we have carpet in my office and this thing really slides badly on carpet.  It doesn't stay put and often slides out from under my cubicle (in the 1/2 in space between the cube wall and floor) into the walkway of my cube farm,  The reviews I read said this worked well on carpet, well, the model I received does not.

It has an on/off switch which you have to manually turn on and off.  With some other models I'd looked at, you turned it on, and it shut itself off after an hour or two.  Not this one.  I often forget to turn it off at the end of the day.  Not a huge problem, but something to be aware of.

As far as heat,  The output isn't great, but after having your feet on it for about half an hour, you will notice a difference.

For the price paid, I expected more. Very disappointing. I would not purchase this item until improvements are made with the sliding issue."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"I purchased this product (DealYard) on 12/26/2013, and received it on 1/2/2014. Was packed well, and arrived in good condition. I used it for the first time on 1/7/2014 and it performed very well, I vacuumed a few bags and tried out the containers and they sealed very well. My next attempt to use was on 1/8/2014 on a couple of the Gal. bags, after a couple of seconds of vacuuming the machine started making a load clicking sound and shut off as though it was done. The problem was it had not removed all the air, and when I repeated the process the same thing happened. Fearing if I continued to try I would irreparably harm the machine I stopped and called the number on the warranty / registration card. I was told that they have not sold this product for over 3 years, and I would have to take it up with how sold it to me. That would be fine if they did not require that the buyer had to pay to have it shipped back to them, half the cost of the product in the first place. WARNING... Before you buy any Foodsaver product make sure you contact Foodsaver and find out if they are going to warranty that particular model at the time you are buying it!!!!!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"Update:
What a difference a few hours can make!  I originally rated this blender at 3 stars earlier today and have now changed my rating to 1 star after using the blender a second time - after using it extremely lightly twice it cracked near the blade (see the product picture I've uploaded).  I was blending liquids so I can't imagine this thing surviving crushing things as the description states.  If you're smart you'll avoid this blender and pay a few more dollars for one that's more durable.

Original review:
This is a nice basic hand/stick blender.  The price was right for what I needed it for - purchased for soap making so I didn't want to spend a ton of money on it.  That being said, I'll probably look for a different one the next time around because this one ended up being bigger and more awkward than I was expecting and I have large hands (if I had smaller hands I definitely wouldn't like using it).  The end with the blade detaches for cleaning which is nice but the blade assembly itself doesn't.

Pros:
Price

Cons:
The whole thing is bigger than I expected and it's awkward to hold and use (you'd have a hard time using it in a glass to blend something small)
The blade doesn't come off for cleaning
Not durable"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"I've owned many-a steam mops in my day, and while this is a great mop that heats up quickly and offers a bunch of nice features, I wouldn't pay the hundred and forty dollars they're asking for this. There are just too many other, cheaper models out there that get your floors just as clean.

Now, if you're someone who sees yourself using the detachable handheld all the time, then this may be the steam mop for you. I THOUGHT I would use it all the time, but in reality I only used it once...the first day I got it.

The machine is light and easy to use while you're actually using it, but if you need to set it down, it's prone to tipping over due to it's shape.  The tank seems to go through water faster than other mops I've used, but maybe that's just me. Or maybe the steam gets hotter than other mops I've used, so it goes through water quicker? I don't know, but I do know I have to fill the tank three times to get all the hardwood/tile/stone in my house done.

Overall, would I recommend this mop? Absolutely. I just don't think it's necessary for the amount of money it costs (unless you really want that detachable steamer). There are plenty of high-quality steam-mops out there for much cheaper."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"First I'll talk about the set-up process. Mercy, it was a pain! Once I got over the overwhelming amount of pieces and hardware, the set-up started off easily enough. I was fooled into thinking things would go smoothly. That changed quickly. I had a hard time getting many of the little hardware pieces to fit where they were supposed to. It was very frustrating. The worst part, I think, was the sticky paper that was attached to the glass-like plastic shelves. It did not come off easily! I ended up having to buy a bottle of ""goo gone"" to help get it off, because it looked so horrible.

Now to the looks of the final product. I don't really have any complaints. It not overly my style, so it's ended up as a storage shelf in my boys' closet. It's hard black plastic and thick white paper for the most part. It looks like something you'd see in a garage or maybe a dorm room or classroom setting. I think more than anything, it will depend on a person's individual style.

Overall, is this something I would recommend to my family and friends? No, unfortunately not. I think there are easier and less expensive options for what it is. Other than the set-up process, though, I don't have any complaints at this point, so I also wouldn't overly NOT recommend it, either."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"I received this South Shore Sebastian 4-Drawer chest at no charge, as part of the Amazon Vine program.  However, I always try to review items as if I had actually paid my own hard earned money for them.  With that being said, I do not think this chest is worth nearly the price that it is currently selling for.  It is made of press board.  It does seem durable enough so far, but press board just cannot compare to real wood for longevity and durability.  The hardware is very nice, and looks expensive.  The finish on the press board looks nice as well, although it is obvious that it is not real wood.  The drawers glide easily.

I give kudos to the manufacturer for including wall-mounting brackets with this chest.  The item seems steady enough on our wood floors, but falling furniture is a frequent cause of injury and death in young children.  It never hurts to be safe, so we have all of the furniture in our toddlers bedroom fastened to the wall.

This is not a large piece of furniture.  According to the specifications here on Amazon, it is 30.5 wide x 16.2 deep x 41.5 inches high.  I think it is a good size for baby or toddler clothes, but as a child gets older, it will not have enough storage space."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"An all in one idea sounds perfect but fails horribly.
Here's all the things that aren't good first:
1. Many parts to clean every time one brews
2. Condensation in the grinder causes coffee grind caking
3. 'Finished brewing' five beeps goes off and there's still 1/4 of the water left in the\ machine

If any of these things go wrong, it leads to big messes and weak coffee.
Way too many things have lead to mornings ruined.  After one spends 5 minutes and 10 gallons of water rinsing all the parts, you have to take this top mechanism piece of cheap plastic off the basket, rinse that, dump the basket, rinse that, check that no grounds are at the bottom of the basket holder, take off the carrafe's lid, check that no rogue grounds are stopping the shut off valve from letting the coffee run.  If you're tired and forget to empty the basket after being distracted from all the other steps, it over flows.  WHen the water collects in the system from not completing brews, you make a pot of coffee and it overflow. Grounds stop the basket hole, it overflows, the shut off valve's stuck with grounds, it over flows.  Think it's working well?  Check behind your counter, there's probably gallons of brewed coffee that has escaped and you don't know it!

ONE FUNNY AND GOOD POINT!  When it works, it makes a delicious cup of coffee!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"UPDATE Mar-2016:  I bought a second one for myself.  Overall, it seems fine, and I like the size of the teapot, but the design allows the last drop of every pour to run down the spout.  Buy the time we are done drinking tea, there is a stain at the bottom of the spout.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:  I bought this teapot for my sister who has been looking for a large teapot for a long time.  This is a nice size teapot that is large enough to serve a party of 6+ people.  With a normal teacup being about 6 oz, the teapot holds about 12 teacups.

I like the plain white classic design as it would go with anything.  The overall quality seems to be very good, although the empty teapot weighs less than I imagined it would just by looking at it.  The small loop handle in the front is very helpful for serving because the full tea pot is quite heavy.

One of the pictures of the white teapot shows a lid open that seems to have a built in brewing vessel, however, the teapot I have received has a plain lid.  Not a big deal for me, but something I feel others should be aware of.

UPDATE: After about a year of regular use the teapot is still holding up well and nothing broke or cracked.  My sister is very happy."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"The pictures clearly show brown furniture and it is advertised as tri-tone brown, but it is not brown. I have numerous different shades of brown furniture in my living room, hardwood floors, and brown wall decor, and none of them make the couch look like the picture. Without a doubt, the furniture is purple. It clashes with everything in our house. The visitors we had over last week called it ""merlot,"" which I believe is a very accurate description. The legs are black and look very cheap (I plan on replacing them).

However, if you think you would like a merlot-colored furniture set, this is a good one for the price. I really like the styling and the leather is quite soft. Even though it is genuine leather, the color is a treatment applied only to the top layer (the color does not saturate the leather), so if you scratch it - or if your cats scratch it - it will be noticeable. We have been staining the scratches as they occur and I think it is an acceptable solution.

Bottom line: the styling is great and it is a very nice looking set, except that the color is not as advertised. We would be 99% happy with the purchase if it would have arrived in any shade of brown whatsoever. If you can get past the color, I think you'll have a hard time matching the quality of this 3 piece set for the price."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"This is one of the few times amazon reviews have let me down. I bought this to have on hand whenever I made my own dressings or sauces that might be used over the course of a few days. My bottle got pushed towards the back of the cupboard and I forgot about it, until I moved and decided I should make use of it since I finally had space for everything.

The first time I went to use it, however, liquid droplets went flying everywhere with the first few shakes! I thought maybe the lid wasn't tight enough, but it still leaked. I held down the flip cap, but still wound up with ingredients running down my arm. It was such a disappointing mess, and the bottle wouldn't exactly look right or be any more functional than any other bottle sans crappy screwtop that I just threw it away (a rarity for me, since I hate throwing away things.)

I was pretty shocked at how useless it was since I remembered the glowing reviews my fellow Amazonians had given it, and because I have other Norpro products that are fairly above-average in terms of functionality and usefulness.

The bottle's looks were pretty plain and utilitarian but I'd overlooked that for the sake of function, but now I think next time I'd prefer a prettier bottle even if it doesn't have useful features like a screw-on lid or flip top cap, since they could likely just be made of fail anyway."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"this coffee maker is great for families that consume lots of coffee...

PROS: it keeps all of the coffee hot.
has a seperate button for those times you only need 1-4 cups...if you don't press this, coffee is not strong (water gets hotter with this button)
large capacity.
beeps when done brewing.
great look on counter!

CONS:1)large design, might be overwhelming in a small kitchen, also you cant really fit under standard sized cabinets, unless u pull out each time you want to make coffee, when you lift top to get to water area, the top will hit the underside of the cabinets.
2) hard to tell how much coffee is in it despite the Full/Empty gauge. beeps very faintly so u must listen in order to hear it when brewing is complete.
3) MAJOR ONE--you need to keep a microfiber cloth under the unit, otherwise the condensation comes out and seems to make the unit leak. also, when u pour water into the reservoir, you need to use a spouted cup to minimize the amount of water that falls out onto the counter...takes some practice, but worth it in the end.

BEST THING TO DO IS BUY WARRANTY THROUGH SQUARETRADE (online), THEY OFFER 3 YEARS ON IT, AND WILL FULLY REFUND PRICE IF IT BECOMES DEFECTIVE WITHIN THAT TIME! YOU DONT NEED A RECEIPT OR ANYTHING, JUST FILL OUT INFO AS SOON AS U BUY THE MACHINE.
OVERALL, GREAT VALUE FOR THE MACHINE...GREAT LOOK, GREAT FILTERS, GREAT CAPABILITIES! 3 STARS BECAUSE OF THE LEAK ISSSUE THAT TAKES ABOUT A WEEK TO GET OVER..AND ALSO SIZE. OTHERWISE, PERFORMANCE DESERVES 5 STARS!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"There are several choices when it comes to cooking utensils: Stainless remains my favorite choice given that it is dishwasher safe, sturdy enough to hold up under force, and thin enough that it can easily get under the cooked product. Silicone, also dishwasher safe, has the advantage of being good for teflon-coated pots and pans but the disadvantage of rarely being tapered sufficiently to get under, say, a sunny-side up egg, without damaging the appearance of the food. Bamboo is a great alternative; though you have to hand wash wood utensils, wood is generally stronger than silicone and can still be used in teflon-coated cookware. The trick, though, is that it has to be cut properly.

This set could have used a little more in the finish department. The colored handles are a nice touch, but the half that touches food is rough to the touch, not quite sanded sufficiently, and doesn't come to as thin an edge as is necessary on the spatula tools. Further, the slotted cuts on two of the utensils had left a few bits of little wood splinters that I needed to make sure were thoroughly removed when I first cleaned the items. The wood was also finished with a light outer coating - some type of urethane? - that wasn't smoothly applied. There are areas which lack the coating, and some areas which appear to have blotches and extra coating.

So overall, the set is ok, particularly as a lightweight set for a camp or RV stove, but at home you would likely be better served with two or three higher grade utensils than this set."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"These are cute and colorful silicone reusable cupcake molds. They will make a smaller than normal cupcake which is fine by me but may not be for everyone.  I found that if you fill the molds half way or more the final resulting cupcake doesn't much resemble a butterfly. If you only fill the molds about the third of the way the finished product will be smaller but will look like a butterfly especially when frosted and decorated.

These molds don't each hold the same shape.  They are fairly thin and do distort easily. They are a bit of work to clean.  My brand new dishwasher didn't get them completely clean so I suggest you wash them by hand, which can be a chore.  I will definitely use these again but not as often as I thought I would.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"I've had this Lunchbots for over a year now.  Overall, it's been a decent container, though only useful for dry goods.  My original intent was to purchase an 'heirloom' lunchbox that was completely foodsafe -- what better choice for that than stainless steel, right?

So anyway, over a year later, the paint regularly chips off.  Each day, there are some paint flakes to be found everyhwere -- in the tote bag I use to carry this container, on the rim, and if I'm not careful, in my food.

Given the times we live in, and that there's no way for me to know for certain whether there's lead, cadmium, or other toxics in the paint, this will soon go into the trash.

In fact, that's why I'm on Amazon today -- I came shopping for a 100% stainless steel replacement.  After seeing this pop up in the search, I thought I'd at least help others by sharing my experience.

Someone did suggest that Lunchbots was extremely customer-service oriented, and would replace the lids -- no questions asked.  That was not my experience at all.  I wrote to customer service, and got a standard 'stock' response back which suggested the product is no longer under warranty and this was considered normal 'wear and tear' -- but that I could buy some replacement lids (which were also painted) if I wanted to, at my expense.

(apparently this comes with a one year warranty, so that's all the product is guaranteed for)

So much for quality and so much for manufacturer product support.

Seriously -- what's the point of spending some $20 for a stainless steel item if it won't last much longer than a year?

Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"I really like this vacuum. Charges quickly. One charge does every room of my 1000 sq ft place. I have hardwood floors with a good amount of dog hair and it does a pretty good job with it. Very easy to empty the container. (Which you will need to do after every sweep.) I recommend making sure you clean out the rollers and intake port fairly frequently. It is a compact vacuum and that's what makes it easy and great; but the intake port is pretty small. Just keep it clean an it will work great. It picks up debris well, gets into tight spots and corners, gets fairly low so that you can get a good ways under beds and couches.

EDIT: 6 months later. I still think this is a great vacuum for the price. It will vacuum about 6 rooms (900=1000sq ft) before needing a charge. It picks up most things well. It works well on pet hair and basic dirt. Bigger things take a couple swipes. You should definitely clean out the intake as much as possible because it is small and can get clogged. It doesn't take long to clean it, but it is a little work. Just a screwdriver or wire coat hanger is needed. The battery charges quickly (maybe an hour or two?) and it hasn't seemed to lose any of its total charge in the time I've had it.

Edit: One and a half years later. This vacuum was a good vacuum for the time that I used it. After a year and a half it has now stopped working as well. Very little suction power. Doesn't pick up dirt like it should. I need a new vacuum now."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"So I have had this fan for a little over a week now. The thing to know about this is it does what it says! It is a swamp cooler that moves air through a wet pad. If you live somewhere that is dry and you know swamp coolers work in your region, then this will work.

My unit uses about a full tank of water every day and a half. I live in south central Texas. The only time I really can tell a difference in the air temperature is when I add ice to the water. This moves a lot of air and has many settings such as swing mode, high, medium, low, nature which alternates between the three, and a timer mode. You also have the option to turn the cooling on and off.

This fan does what it is advertised to do as long as you are using it in a dry climate. It moves a lot of air and could even be used as a humidifier.

UPDATE
I have now had this for about a month. I have taken great care of it. It literally was taken out of the box, placed in a corner on flat ground, and turned on and off each day. It worked well for the first month but it is now leaking! I am a handy person and I still can't figure out where the water is coming from. The water storage is in great condition so it has to be something with the hose line or water catching system from the wet pad. I can't figure out where it is coming from. The zip ties used to secure the hose are tight. I'm pretty dissatisfied after spending about $100"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"Received shoe rack in a reasonable amount of time.  Assembly is easy enough (15-20 minutes).  Shoe rack is stable.

The finish of the metal tubing is nice aesthetically. The plastic connectors work well, but look a bit cheap and may also remind you of children's connecter toys.

My biggest issue with the rack itself is the shelving material.  It resembles black weed control paper you'd put under mulch, with a thin plastic layer on top.  Will it hold shoes and be pretty easy to clean, yes I think so.  Is it a durable material....No.  If you think this rack will receive any amount of abuse or rough handling, I might look elsewhere.

Now to the sellers service:
My rack was missing four tubes needed to complete assembly.  I contacted the seller and the following was our (abridged) discourse.

Seller:. Can you please take a picture of missing pieces and send (via email) so we can verify what is needed.

Me: Pictures sent

Seller: These components are out of stock.  Can you buy them elsewhere and we will reimburse you?

Me: That is unacceptable.  You are the manufacturer of these components. Open another box if need be, and please send me what is needed to complete the shoe rack you sold me.

Seller: components are out of stock, we are issuing you a refund.

Ultimately, I felt like they were trying to get me to drop my request by making things less straight forward than they should have been, but I don't know that for sure, and I do appreciate that in the end they rectified the situation.

Take this for what it's worth.  It's a utility shoe rack and the seller is responsive and NOT in the business of cheating customers."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"Ignoring common sense and warnings on the Web, I bought one of these hand held Dyson DC34 vacuums for about 4 times what I'd pay for a high end competitor's model (e.g. Black and Decker LiIon model). When I got it, I was initially very pleased: Good suction, worked very well. The battery life is short (maybe 6-7 minutes on a charge), but I knew that going in, and that's just part of the package.

Then, after a number of months, the machine began stopping after a few seconds. It wasn't that the battery wasn't charged: I could use it for a few seconds, have it stop, play games with the unit, get it to run for maybe 20-30 second, have it stop, play more games, and so on to get the full 5-6 minutes out of it. But the unit just failed to run continuously for more than a fraction of a minute. I went online and discovered this is a horribly common problem with this model. I contacted Dyson and had them tell me that the unit was out of its (short) warranty and that I'd need to buy another one.

That's not going to happen. Instead, I'll try to warn you all not to waste your money on this machine that, apparently, has design defects. Instead, get a high end (LiION battery) Black & Decker, or similar model for a quarter of the price. It might not be 100% as good as a vacuum, but it's assuredly 90% as good, and in addition, you'll get a much longer lifetime out of it. And when it dies, you can buy another THREE before you're up to the cost of this piece of poorly designed junk.

I was burned. You don't have to be."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"This is the worst purchase I have ever made from Amazon. I have had the mattress for several days, opened and laying on my bed frame. It is supposed to be a 6 inch mattress and won't inflate beyond 4 inches. I got tired of sleeping in a recliner and tried to sleep on this thing last night. After an hour of being completely uncomfortable, I put my old two inch foam topper on it and tried sleeping again. No go. This thing gives and doesn't bounce back. It's like sleeping on a board. I am sore all over after my two attempts at trying to sleep. I am contacting Amazon for a return/refund. Don't waste your time buying thing thing, even for a guest room -- your guests will hate you if you do! And, when it was opened, there was a stink in the room coming off the mattress. It off gassed for two days. I received this in Nov, 2017 and the tag on the mattress said it was made in China in Sept, 2016. So it was manufactured, then rolled up tight for over a year. No wonder it doesn't inflate. I am very, very disappointed in this. UPDATE: I returned the mattress to Amazon. There was no hastle, arranged for UPS to pick it up and the refund to my account was issued within 2 hours of being picked up. The hardest part about the return was rolling up the mattress (it was very stiff in the middle), tying it off, wrapping it up in the plastic it came in and then taping card board all around the plastic. I probably didn't have to do all of that but I did it anyway, just to be sure it arrived in one piece. Don't  waste your money on this product."

By the way, my carpet areas are only 11x11 and 13x13 which the 16ft cord is just right! (For larger jobs I first use my manual Bissell Sweep-up and after picking up the larger pieces I use my featherweight vacuum. This keeps my featherweight from becoming clogged and preserving it.)
5. Quiet enough not to wake the entire neighborhood!

Needs some work:
1. The dust cup is small, which means you must empty after each use, and sometimes dust flies all over the front of the cup. Wet paper towel to the rescue!
2. Made of cheap plastic but what do I expect for $20!
3. No storage cup for the crevice attachment, but Velcro does wonders!
4. Needs a brush roll to get thru thick carpet!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"Got this product to do our upstairs (only area that is carpeted in our home). Ordered on sale, and got the item promptly through Amazon. Fast forward to 4 months later (we never took it out of the box) and opened it to get to work since we were expecting company. Instructions were horrendous, but finally got the thing put together. My husband and I couldn't figure out why the vac was not standing upright on its own, but kept falling backwards. Figured something must be missing and/or not put together properly. We dumped the Hoover box upside down in an effort to see if there were any missed parts and the only thing that fell out was a teeeeennnnyyyy tiny piece of plastic (think size of a marble). Turns out that little piece of plastic had a big job-it held up the ENTIRE machine. A bit stunned that some genius thought plastic would be good to use for such a crucial part of the machine, I called Hoover expecting them to stand behind their ""One Year Warranty"" that the machine came with. Explained the situation to a Hoover rep who assured me that we could take it to an authorized Hoover store for free repair. I was also confident since the machine was not even used once that the Hoover store could verify that clearly this had not been our fault. Wrong again. We got a phone call 2 days later informing us that the plastic piece that was broken was NOT covered under warranty and it would cost $120.00 to fix. ARE YOU SERIOUS?!?? Oh yes, let's pay for a piece of (*#&(W*#&( machine twice. I think not. This has been the worst experience and I will NEVER purchase anything Hoover again. Cheap plastic, poor design, horrible customer service. Lesson learned the hard way, hope others can learn from our mistake. What a joke!!!! Hoover gets a F- in my book."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"I received my  Black & Decker Allure Iron  and quickly discovered signs that it had been returned.  The cord was not neatly wrapped. The tab on the box was open. There were fingerprints on it. I plugged it in  and found that it would only heat to about 130. Then a thin line of smoke came up from the iron. I returned it and Amazon promptly sent me a new one. With the wonderful reviews I've seen here I was confident that the this one would work beautifully!  Sadly this one wouldn't get hot enough either!  It put out a good amount of steam but only heated again to about 130. I tried ironing a cotton garment  and it just wouldn't get all of the wrinkles out! Let me assure you, I followed the instructions in the manual to the letter! The second one went back too. I got a quick refund. Despite the great reviews I just wasn't ready to try my luck on a third! Very disappointing!
Update: I very much appreciated Spectrum Customer Service reaching out to me. I contacted them and they sent me a new iron. Sadly this iron performs about the same as the others. I checked the temperature of the soleplate when set on ""linen"". The temperature was in the 130s in some areas, high 120s in others. My research shows that an the temp should be about 235 on linen, 204 on cotton. 135 is good for nylon, acrylic , spandex. This iron puts out good steam and will get mild wrinkles out of cotton (when set on linen) but won't remove a crease. It won't get linen completely smooth. This is 3 out of 3 Allure irons that won't get hot enough. I would encourage other reviewers to check their irons with an infrared thermometer and see what readings you get, especially if you purchased yours in the last few months."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"My wife is very particular about ""her things"", and when her tea kettle was starting to rust out, she hinted that she would like a new one for her birthday.  So I found this highly reviewed kettle on Amazon and thought it a good deal for many years of service.  When my wife received it for her birthday, she was not completely satisfied, but over the past two months she has ""gotten used to it"".  Here are her complaints:

1. Difficulty getting water into it.
  - with my wife's old kettle, she filled it through the spout.  The spout on this kettle is a bit narrower than her old one, so at first water would spill down the side and get the outside wet.  She also tried to use the filling lid on top, but the lid has tight tolerances (so steam doesn't escape or rattle around), and the handle doesn't move, so there is no clear path to the pot without getting the outside wet.

2. Difficulty eating water out of it.
  - as you can see from the picture, the spout protrudes from the upper quarter of the pot.  This means she has to hold the kettle at an almost 90 degree angle to pour her hot water, and dousing her hand with a good bit of hot steam.  With filling the kettle a bit fuller than she is used to, we are able to get around that problem.

Now that she's had two months of kettle ownership, she is much better at aiming water into the kettle, and doesn't have so many problems.  She has also noticed that with the flatter and wider bottom of the new kettle, it does heat faster, and it is easier to clean with the nice enameled finish.  However, I think next time that we need a new kettle, I'm just going to install a hot water dispenser at the sink."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"Okay, I actually have one of these, was given as a gift at xmas.  It works fine, the machine is crazy simple (nothing electric, just a lever) and the CO2 cartridge is very easy to install and remove.  Because the person giving the gift bought them I have two bottles and two of the 4oz cartridges.  I personally get 11 liters from the 4oz charge (I've been keeping track to see and that's been pretty consistent).

At the moment you can at least go to Bed Bath and Beyond stores and EXCHANGE the small cartridge for $10 (buying an extra filled one off the shelf costs $20).  You just go to the cashier/service desk there and they'll have a box of refilled ones behind the counter that they'll swap with you and charge $9.99.

But they promise 16oz cartridges as an option and I have yet to find these available anywhere.  Just thinking as reading this I should contact Cuisinart and ask where I can get one.  For heavy use you probably don't want to buy one of these for yourself at least until the 16oz cartridges are reasonably available and able to be exchanged at the lower price.  I wouldn't expect to ever come out ahead on cost even with with the larger cartridge.  I mean, I can buy some bottles of plain seltzer (which is mainly what I'm making) for about 70 cents a liter.  You can get some CO2 less than that but can't get it low enough to recoup the cost of the machine I don't think.  it IS a space saver though if you're a heavy user of fizzy beverage products.  If I exchange one CO2 cartridge while the other still has some charge then I basically never run out yet only have two bottles taking space in the fridge.  Plus I'm not going through a ton of disposable bottles.  That's worth something I guess."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"This was my second waring blender. Previously, I had one that was a bit shorter. This one can fit a lot of liquid, but apparently it is not meant for crushing ice. Huh? It is a bar blender. What is it for then? I only found this out because when my husband accidentally broke ours by blending a few cubes of ice (along with milk, bananas, yogurt), we contacted waring to see if it was under warranty and if it could be replaced. The blender would turn on but the blade didn't seem to be spinning anymore. Waring asked if we had used ice in the blender ""because it wasn't designed to crush ice."" We explained that t had, but only a small amount. Long story short, waring offered a once in a blue moon replacement blender top, but ""just this time."" Two to 3 weeks later it had still not arrived. My husband contacted the lady to ask her if she had shipped the replacement, because we really just wanted to know if we needed to buy a new blender so we could make smoothies in the mornings again. The replacement blender is $60-100, depending on where you buy it, so yeah we were waiting for the free one. The blender finally arrived, after hassling the lady again. I stuck my hand in the box and hundreds of shard of glass sliced into my skin. So, that was nice. The blender had been barely bubble wrapped. We didn't bother requesting a new one, and bought an entirely different blender instead. We bought the Farberware 4-speed  digital blender for $40.00 and have been happilly blending ever since. I used to be a blender snob, but unless you are going to fork over the money for a BlendTec or Vitamix, or something along those lines, there is really no point to spend a lot. I'm sorry but if a waring blender can't make a semi-frozen smoothie, what can it do? Puree soups?"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"This makes a truly excellent cup of coffee or espresso - for one person. Probably you can't make a better cup given a particular roast of bean.  I just think it should be bigger.  We like strong coffee and a nice big cup of it. We make two big cups of coffee and we basically have to repeat the whole process twice. And if you have more people, well, I have other things to do with my day, just get out the old dripper I guess. If they made one twice as big I think it would be a huge improvement.

The key insight of this coffee maker is to use lots of coffee, let it soak in the water, and above all, do NOT get the water so hot. 160 or 170 degrees - you won't get the bitterness and off tastes as with hotter water. Now, using this insight, I have been able to use a drip basket instead of the Aeropress in a pinch, and get about the same quality a beverage. A lot of filter baskets taken out of drip machines have a little valve on the bottom so the coffee only drips out when a coffee pot is underneath. You can just put the filter and coffee and the not-too-hot water into this filter basket, and wait a couple minutes, then release the valve and let the coffee drain into a cup. Same quality as you get with an Aeropress, and it just proves that the not-too-hot water soak method is the key.

Frankly as they are not making a bigger model of this I think I will get a French Press. Use not-so-hot water, and make as much coffee as you need without going through the motions 2, 3, 4 times. I think the only problem with that is that a French Press does not have as fine a filter as the Aeropress and you will need to use a coarser grind of coffee or end up with a lot more sediment in your cup."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,negative,truthful,"I bought the Griddler in February of 2005 and have taken care to ensure it lasts. The Griddler is heavy and sturdily constructed. It heats up quickly, and cleans up even faster. We have used it for panini, grilling meat, and toasting burger buns.  The unit can be used either as a panini/grill press with the floating top or opened up to use as a griddle.

The base of the unit heats up and maintains temperature better than the top. This creates uneven toasting of the Panini or other items. It's not so much of a problem using as a griddle, since one side will simply cook faster than the other.

After a year the nonstick surface has started pealing off of the grill plates. I have never used metal on the nonstick surface and have taken great care to preserve the finish. Perhaps it is in the design or a fate of nonstick coated products in general, but the now I will have to take care not to get pieces of the nonstick surface in my food.

The Griddler comes with interchangeable dishwasher safe griddle and grill plates with a lock and release system that is intuitive to use.  The plates easily release with the press of a button for cleaning.  To place the plates back on the Griddler, one simply rests the plates in the groves located towards the rear or bottom and snaps the front or top into place.  The plates don't consistently stay attached in the top section like they once did. It's very annoying trying to reposition a hot plate back into place.

On the surface, the Griddler has the looks and design to be a great product. Cuisinart has some bugs to work out to attain even heating and plates that last. If I were to buy a new panini press, I would not look to Cuisinart again.  As a matter of fact, I now enjoy using a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Breville-800GRXL-Indoor-Barbeque-and-Grill/dp/B000A76VCO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Breville 800GRXL Indoor Barbeque and Grill</a>&nbsp;instead.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"It's a nice viewer when it works, you can't turn it on and off if the SD card is in it causing you to hit the reset button every time."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"This is a great accessory for paintball or Air-soft, only complaint is it can be hard to breath through when you're exerting yourself, and it gets quite warm under that thing."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,The die itself is fine. I just was trying to get one that would expand the brass to .358 for loading coated 9mm bullets. This is still too small for that.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"Poor straps, after one week one of the straps holding the legs was torn apart. I am not heavy, but it seems the material quality of this chair are very low."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"My hubby didn't love these.  He is fond of the Beach Body workouts and weight workouts but the heavy weights was more than he wanted, we ended up selling ours."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"they work well

BUT!!!...

If you bench press alone in your garage or basement, you know the deal don't use them so you can slide the weights off your chest if you get stuck!!"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,Squeaky when you sit down. The fabric rubs on the bars. My wife suggested using candle wax on the bars and that worked great. Can't have a squeaky seat in a hunting blind.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"This is a great concept, however the holes do not fit 7-strand paracord.  It is frustrating when it arrives and you realize that you have to drill out the holes to fit."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,Smaller than I expected from what I thought I was looking at on the I suggest that a size or liter capacity could be added to the information given in the sales pitch
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,This Hand Warmer is okay for the price.  It is kinda flimsy though.  It doesnt hold shape like a cylinder like the ones the Pros wear but it does the job.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"Needs improvement on design, once toddler fall asleep which is very easily, the system doesn't support her body well and the main rider have to use one hand to support her head, dangerously."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"I bought the two pack. After wearing one of them for less than four days, the compass was/is in correct. Doesn't even read the same as the other which has not been worn."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"New formula sucks.  Tampered with an iconic brand.

Hey, everyone, try Weimans Brass Polish.  It's exceptional stuff.  Their products are generally amazing.  I am now off Brasso and onto Weimans."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,It wasn't that expensive but is kind of small and uncomfortable to hold.  The cord on the handle came undone after a couple of uses and then frayed.  It was sharp though.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,This was a gift so although I purchased it awhile ago we just opened it.  There was no repair kit or stuff bag to store it in all I hot was the mattress
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"The image shown with this rod shows that it comes with a stop and a centering guide. These items are not included in the package, and they are the reason I ordered this rod."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,These fit tight which I thought it was supposed to be tight. Size large. But I was told they are bad for obstacles racing. I ended up pulling my calves muscle. First time ever.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"Seam popped within second use.  Since then the seam has popped in several other places.  We still use it, but I don't know how much longer it will stay in one piece."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,I like garys bikinis much better. This I like the idea if a pouch so your privates feel secure. like the look. But not the fit. - am 170 - 5'9''. Athletic.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"sorry but this helmet was very bulbous and awkward to wear. i was expecting a more low profile and snug fitting helmet, what i got was something that made me look like a beluga whale."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"Even though I bought the extra-large, it's way too tight. The pocket over the bust would appear very lumpy and awkward under clothes. The weave is very tight and it would be warm to wear."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,I bought the junior size for my 7yo (she is 70th% for height and weight) and the wrist guards were way too small. I think the junior size fits size 4-6yo. Hopefully the smalls fit
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"Smaller than expected, but i am not very good with measurements. Looks good, came clean and  un-damaged. Looks great outside. Got it for the nines an hubby for the back yard. Nice conversation starter."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"I used it once and the foot strap already broke, I am really disappointed, I am a personal trainer and I was recommending it for my customer, so it's a shame the quality is really bad"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,I washed them by hand before using and the dark color bleeds way too much especially the black one. I washed it 3 times and the color bleeding didn't stop so I gave up on it.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,cheap quality and leaked when we needed it most.  middle of hiking in the Grand Canyon.  spend more and get more.  I learn this lesson the hard way with so many cheaper finds.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"Returned it. I watched the video, and then watched it again, and then read the instructions and really wanted this pillow to work. But No, it was just lumpy and nothing I could do about it."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"Thinner than I anticipated so doesn't line up perfectly with the existing stuff we had and easily come apart if you do anything with lateral motion, but still decent padding and definitely better than our cement basement"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"This light has never worked right. I ordered it for my daughter and she just put in on her bike last week. Just realized it's two days out of return policy, but the blinking light doesn't work."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,Way too small. I even bought a size up and they are still very tight. Almost less comfortable to cycle in these verses no padding (not saying much since there already is very little padding in these)
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"Product delivered on time. The light itself seems satisfactory for taillight duties. The bracket seems cheesy. Very difficult to disconnect the light from the bracket. I give the light itself a 4 star, the bracket a 2 star."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"Heavy duty cover with two reinforced holes for tie down or bungee. This is my second cover, 1st one of these lasted well over two years in direct Texas sun, wind and inclement weather. You won't be disappointed."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"Terrible. They claim these are Stainless Steel but are cheap aluminum. I wouldn't hang a picture of these things, let alone swings or weights. Go to Home Depot or any hardware store and buy the real, heavy duty thing."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"A lot of play in the winder arm! The one I bought on Amazon, the arm popped out of the watch! I do not believe the hype around this Mako line. Spend a little more and get a Seiko 007."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"I have used about three-fourths of a jar (possibly purchased elsewhere). It now has a fairly strong smell of paint thinner, or something similar, when I open the jar. It is not labeled as organic. Perhaps that odor is pesticide."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,Oh god this is just to funny cause they are just junk.. I'm not sure what to feel it to  laugh or just trash them and call it a learning experience. There just paper weight toys.. Useless and junk..
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,Giving it two stars because the lights work. But the suction cup design does not hold it together as it shows in promos. Maybe ours is defective and if it worked as the promo shows I could give it more stars
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,Only two side of mine are hemmed and I hand washed it before using as per some of the reviews because the dye does need to be rinsed. Outside of that it works for me and has held up so far.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,i got this item to go on my 22 rifle. looks and seemed to work great. took it to the range on my 22 rifle and i couldn't even seen the red dot on the brightest setting. spent your money else where.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"PAIN IN THE BUTT. None of the attachments seem to thread into the two sizes of cleaning rods without an adapter. I truly detest this thing as I cannot justify buying something else after spending money on this, I live with it."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,This is the second pair of these exact goggles that I have ordered this week that came with the mirrored coating very badly damaged. I returned the first pair that came and now I will be returning these. I am very disappointed.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"It's an emergency blanket in the shape of a bivy. It is not a ""sleeping bag"" just sayin. It's o.k. for what it's designed for, but don't be miss-lead this isn't something you would count on for a week in the woods camping."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,The air pump is use less. You can barely get 20psi in a tire. And it doesn't fit in the bag. The bag is difficult to strap under the seat. The multi-tool is the only good thing about the kit. Wasted my money.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"Just bought some of these from Walmart for $1.98....$8 seems a little ridiculous.

I haven't used them yet...trying to make an adapter to match the threaded part (my hydration pack is not Outdoor Products).
Other than that they seem well designed and worth 2-5 dollars."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"Used these once and they are relative crap. Why you ask? Because that big, solid panel in the middle turns these into fans, which creates a burst of air that moves bugs (especially the little guys) out of harm's way. Windy Hill, indeed."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"I think I bought fake shoes. The insole is rubbed
up in the second day. However, I was told the insole cannot be changed. What should I say?

I have to sort the insole by hand when the insole rubbed up to make me comfortable."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"What a horrible product.  Horrible!  Why would someone sell a product without a valve for inflation?  That is correct.  No valve.  No way to put air in it--it does contain air so it can leak out; and, it does."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,Maybe I can't complain because it was a cheap polo. I was hoping to start buying polos directly online instead of the store. But the quality and look of the polo are bad enough that I don't plan to ever wear it... lesson learned.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,Its a really snug fitting case.  I haven't worked with the case enough to get the gun where it slides in and out easily.  Also tends to slide the slide back when trying to insert into holdster since its a tight fit.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"One ring mount fit the rail, the other didn't without excessive force, but backed it off the rail after a half inch to avoid damage to rail and / or mount ring.  Requesting exchange & hoping for a dual fit on second attempt."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"It was really cute, but good only for a younger or smaller toddler. My son just turned three (39"", 39lb) when I ordered it; I returned it as I did not see him getting much use out of it (too small to work for long)."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"These are not the greatest deadlifting socks. They're a little on the thin side for deadlifts. The huge benefit is that i do look like Flash Gordon, even though me shins are dripping with blood. It is better to look good than to feel good."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,The product is reasonably priced but it doesn't look realistic at all ..it's four blow up decoys that I used today to go turkey hunting ..I heard all kind of turkeys clucking purring gobbling or no turkeys will come within 60 yards of the decoys
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,I bought the biggest one and can't hardly zip it up. The tight fit may be good for warmth but if you're one inch taller or wider than me forget it! I should've sent it back but it'll work in a pinch so I kept it.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"This is nothing special, but it does what it is supposed to do. I've used it in one race and it held my timing tag in place nicely. I wanted something that allows me to change my shoes or wear none, depending on how I feel."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"I didn't know these were 108s when I bought them, so thats my fault, but even so the closure isn't that great and the wraps are just a bit more stiff than I'd like, they don't stay on my hands as well as I'd like either."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"This is a great time piece, however for me the big downside is;
 In low lighted situation the hands will disappear and or are cammaflogde by the details on the face of the watch ma king it impossible for me to read. Not for low light"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,Hatchet arrived covered in some oily substance that smelled and left black marks on hands. Perhaps like curing a cast iron pan however this isn't iron. Looked used. Heavy and fits nicely in hand and will be used for son and husband as they backpack and camp.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"Appears well made, but the clamping mechanism is not strong enough to support my 8 lbs air rifle fully extended, bent the bottom pole within 5 min, works ok if you re adjust it after a couple shots, gets the job done for the price I suppose"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"Headphones work well, volume is good and they shut out loud noises. However, the range, particularly on the AM frequency is spotty. Makes me wish it had a more powerful antenna. If you live in a populated place with good reception it probably won't be a problem."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"I THOUGHT THEY WERE BIG ENOUGH AT THIS SIZE TO BE FUN FOR HANDGUN SHOOTING, AND THEY ARE NOT. THE INLAID TARGETS ARE TOO SMALL TO DISTINGUISH FROM 15'-17'. I'LL GIVE THEM TO MY BUDDY RIFLE SHOOTERS TO USE UP, SO I'LL SAY BAD CHOICE ON MY PART."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"Nice low-cost alternative, but won't stand up to much abuse.  Surprisingly, it did hold up to extensive lateral force without bending, but at the end of hey strenuous day, one section had become jammed so tightly into the one above it I could not get them apart."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"And they don't tell which one to buy?
And it costs $15 on their website?
And it costs nearly $10 to ship it to your house? SERIOUSLY?

I WAS BORN AT NIGHT, but not last night....

I don't think so. I'll buy a knock off brand & have it shipped for $5 thanks."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"I really wanted to like these glasses but couldn't keep them on my head long enough without the retaining band. With that said, they are lightweight and comfortable with clear optics but having to wear a retaining band looking like ski patrol dudes from the 90's is not my thing."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"Super cheap, grips rub off after it hits the ground 50 times. Very poorly made. Paid $7 on black friday for it so I cannot complain however its not worth it, maybe as a christmas gift for a six year old or for a baby to roll around with it."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,Terrible rear wheel design.....after a few months use the rear wheels disintegrate.  We have gone thru 3 sets of wheels.  Razor Customer service would only offer 1/2 PRICE SHIPPING on replacement wheels.  Look for another toy for your child.  Purchased the unit in December of 2014.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"Very strong chemical smell, I bought these for self-massage per the suggestion of my massage therapist.  They work great but I had to wrap them in several layers of saran wrap to keep the odor contained.

As for lacrosse, bah, I have no idea if they are good or not!"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,These work but not super easy to use and it may take more than a few to get the job done so on a dollar cost basis the are not very cheap. I can see the utility of them but I could also just see using a chamber brush too.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,These lures look great but simply never produced a single fish for me. Now Im no pro angler but I do get state award fish each year so I feel I know enough to give my input. Ill stick to my Rapalas all day catching 8 lbs bass and channel catfish.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"Kinks and slides.  I have a small home gym and 20 square feet of this.  It's always kinking up and doesn't ""lock"" very well.  It is on carpet, so that's probably the real culprit.  It does feel nice on the feet though.  So I keep it."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"The bottoms held up for about 3 months of light use before needing super glue to hold the felt.  The bottom is hollow.
One is cracked, so they are not that durable... Even though my kids were using them it seems like they could be made slightly thicker less brittle plastic."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"Our daughter's swim school has several pair of these goggles on hand to loan students during class, so I thought I'd get some for my daughter.  Oddly, both pair that I ordered leaked water immediately.  She tried adjusting them many different ways, but they would not hold the water out."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,Sizer die started scaring brass after about thirty rounds. Junk. Should have purchased RCBS or Redding dies. Contacted Lee and they wanted me to ship the die back and would not pay shipping. They said they would give me credit on my next purchase. Why would I want to purchase more junk?
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"I put this on one of my bikes and it snapped right in place. Transferred it to another bike (same saddle) and it took a little finesse. Transferred it back to the first bike for another ride and it broke. Stick to traditional fenders. This might have some sex-appeal, but it's not durable."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"It will probably work OK on powder burning rifles, but does not work on air rifles. Save your money on this model, and drop some more for the V3 version. Night and day difference between the two models. V3 more money, but more sensitive, has a SD card, more mounting options, on and on."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"They'd be great for weather in the 25-60 degree range. They're too hot to use in warmer weather and once they're wet, they stay wet much longer than my other, comparable socks. This makes sense given they're thicker and would be better suited to colder weather anyway. They're also overpriced for what they are."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,Item is necessary if you have the Downmat and want to use the pump bag to inflate it. I really feel they are charging way to much at $10 for this piece. It should be included for free or only a couple dollars max. It is well made and works great but way over priced.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"These were my size but too baggy on my legs and a little too long overall. They were tight on my butt and loose at the waist, so I could not size down. Besides the sizing issues, the shorts were very comfortable. I would not wear these out, but just indoors due to sizing issues."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"I haven't tried to strength test this, but it looks like it is of decent quality. It's not fancy, looks like it was hand wrapped from a larger spool. Hope I don't need it for anything serious, but it's nice to have on hand for an emergency shelter or strapping something down in the truck."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"There is a ton of excess zipper hanging  from the inside (it itches). I thought this was a full zip. It is not, it goes down to my naval and stops.  It doesn't stop like a normal zipper that has a guard. The zipper is stopped by questionable stitching rather than a zipper end."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"Not many choices when looking for a holster for the Kimber Pepper Blaster.  It tends to slide down and ride on the top of your shoe, but I that's probably a characteristic of most ankle holsters.  The snap strap is reliable and holds the Pepper Blaster in place, even when running, which is important."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"I was hoping that I could pin my baseball jersey to the inside. There is no felt to pin the jersey down and had to use the hanger...not a fan of that look. However, the frame is nice and well made. I wold buy this again if I wanted the jersey to hang at the top."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"I tried a few of these to keep around as extras if I lose my good one or is I have people training with me that didn't bring gear. Pretty thin and flimsy, also quite small. OK enough for a temp or for weightlifting but not something I would want to spar hard with at all."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"I have had two of these and they are waterproof and comfortable to wear.  Both of them lost function after four to six months.  The step counting is good if you wal and swing your arms, or if you run.  Slow walking, or pushing a cart will  not be picked up as steps."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"Great little air horn. However, I was disappointed with the construction quality. Although rated to 150 psi, the canister bottom buckled and bulged outward at only 75 psi. The unit was pressurized slowly using a hand-operated bicycle pump with a pressure gauge. It works fine, but I'm always concerned that it might rupture when I refill the canister."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"Not too great. I thought since it was speedo it might be perfect. Used to come off during the swim as well. Tried it only in the pool.
Would definitely go for the Premium Silicone Swim Cap or the spandex swim cap any day before this one.
I would only use this if I lost all my other swim caps."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"Somehow missed the detailed picture of the pellet. Arrived in good shape. Pellets are in a round metal can which is nice for storage. The pellets are hollow point with a point protruding in the center. I was expacting a solid, pointed nose. Not sure of the  ballistic performance but suspect at normal distances it's a don't care."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"The toe area ripped on my first day wearing these (a 3 mile ride). Pics for reference. I didn't scrape my toe against the ground. Maybe I just pulled them on too tight? If I hadn't, the under strap would have covered my cleats and I wouldn't have had a solid connection with my pedals. I'll stick with warmer socks."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"This appears to be a nice lightweight hat. Unfortunately, it runs too small for a ""one size fits all"". Most of these hats will fit heads up to 60cm of circumference or so. I doubt this hat will fit people with heads over 58cm. If you have problems with ""one size fits all"" caps, this hat is definitely not for you."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"The material is nice and soft. Definately NOT Squat Proof. I even ordered a size up (I's a 4/6 Lulu, Sm in Athleta, Sm in Nike) and the Med in these tights were SOOOO see thru. You could see the VS writing/logo on my panties. NO THANKS. I do feel they fit true to size and would stay with a Small"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,This product is well made but my slender and tall 9 year old found it to be too uncomfortable and refused to wear it.  We tried several other brands with the same issue until we found the Nutty Buddy System here on Amazon.  It may be more comfortable for children who aren't so slender but didn't work for my son.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"It's not well constructed.  I haven't used it to field dress a deer yet, but out of the package the knife seems sharp, but the blade wiggles greatly.  The blade wiggles so much that I'm afraid the lock may break and there goes my fingers.  I can't suggest this item.  There are better dressing knifes for just $5 more."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"great product for fishing. super for night fishing. I recommend if you buy these , get more than you think you need because they do not hold tight when trying to set the hook. ( lost 2 already ) they fly off when trying to set hook. better to take off before setting hook. I ordered 20 pieces and only 17 arrived unbroken."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"It takes forever (guess it could be worse having to inflate with your mouth) but the hose will not stay on. So you have to hold the end of the hose in place on the mattress and the pump all while trying to pump the mattress up.
Other than that very frustrating part, the mattress does its thing and retains the air fairly well."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"This is a ditto on the previous review.  Bought it at Walmart.  Installed it , did not work as advertised.  I had to hold the receiver no further than 6 inches from the transmitter.  I too though it could be the batteries so I bought two fresh ones with the same result.  I am contacting the manufacturer on Monday."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"These tubes are nearly impossible to accidentally puncture, but they fail in the 12-1/2 x 2-1/4"" size because the stems are straight rubber.  I tried to use them on a Trikke 12, and all of the stems tore after multiple refillings, since they have to be bent outward to attach a pump.  What good is an indestructable tube with fragile valve stem?"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"The brake levers work great.  I just never liked how the brakes clamped onto my handlebars.  The ridge where the screw is located always dug into my palms.  I ended up buying Paul Love levers because the clamp is oriented in a different location.
On flat handlebars, the clamp would be in the right spot, but not on upright swept back handlebars."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"Read very carefully the dimensions. This bag is so small that I would be able to fit my gym clothes, maybe.

I decided to donate this bag, because dealing with the company for returns was frustrating and not worth it.

I got what I paid for, 10$ worth of nothing.

If you are looking for a tiny, almost child's size bag, with good zippers, you may like it."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,I don't like the fact that its so tight and my hair still gets soaked. I get done swimming and my forehead has lines across it that the cap leave. Like for or 5 lines and the indentation stays for a few hours after the fact. I teach swim so in the pool for hours at a time would love a product that does not leak.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"Nice little Aerator for small areas,would probably only use it for bait,NOT meant for Bass Tournament Quality,as this pumps air into the livewell or tank it is not OXYGEN which fish need to stay alive and healthy,(if you were in a tournament and had 5 Large/Smallmouth Bass in a livewell and this was the only thing running,chances are they will not be alive at weigh in time)"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,I use these at the shooting range and they're just OK. They don't seem to be 29 reduction but I don't know that I can tell that much difference. I like that they fold and they seem to hold up well but they are not as effective as others I have used. I often use foam earplugs instead because those don't interrupt my sighting on my stock.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"Works okay. The pistol is very hard to cock. The rifle shootsway off sights and there is no way to make it more accurate. I have woodpeckers that decide to take up residence from time to time. It is close enough to frighten them, but not close enough to hit one for a lasting lesson. They are usually about 60 feet away, so this is some serious inaccuracy."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,I can barely get two or three targets to set before shooting the third or forth makes them fall back down.......It is what it is....not a bad target to shoot pellets at and at least you get some movement and noise. I'm shooting at it with a .22 caliber Beeman Silver Kodiak X2 at around 800 FPS .....25 yards....and it had dented and distorted the targets pretty bad.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,I ordered 2 and they don't work and have to be sent back. I'm baffled because they were in original box and perfect looking shape.  I have the exact light for a year and know how to charge it and all so that's  not the problem but something is wrong with the 2 I ordered. When my current light works I will give it 5 stars
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,I love the light and the fact that it can easliy be removed. I also really like the idea of the mount. Unfortunatley the mount doesn't works so well. It fits great but the lever that keeps it tight will not stay closed. This means it won't stay tight. Fixed it with a rubber band. I'm going to keep it because I think the light is really well made.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"This rope is 30ft long and is thin, reflective and lightweight and packs up small. However, the biggest negative for me, and one of the reasons I don't use it much, is because it tangles up so easily. The reflective tape they have woven into the rope makes it tangle even easier than it normally would without the reflective material. But for $12, I'm not going to complain too much."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"I was disappointed with this Frankford Arsenal bullet puller...the one I got broke within 2 minutes of use and had to return for another...also, I don't like having to change out the collets depending on the caliber of bullet you are reclaiming..I should have stayed with the one collet RCBS hammer I had to start with...I gave it to a friend and choose to try a new one..shame on me."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,The description says these socks are seamless - they absolutely are not.  I had a big seam going down every toe which caused constant rubbing.  These socks are so uncomfortable and rubbed my toes/toe webbing so much that I had to take them off after 20 minutes of use (my toes are now sore).  I *highly* recommend you pass on these socks - I will be returning mine.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"I've been wearing this suit for about two and a half months swimming in a school pool for aout half an hour 2-3 days a week (rinsing thoroughly after with tap water and hand washing once a week) and the material is wearing thin, sorry to have to look for a replacement so soon, but it was a great starter suit while I decided whether I would stick with the swimming!"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,It is okay for a tent. I dislike how there are no window covers on the sides. You basically need to use the tarp for privacy. This doesn't work well when you're camping in a Texas winter and only need privacy for a second to change clothes. I disliked how it stated it was on a huge sale for prime day when really that is the normal price on any other day.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"I purchased the Flitz gun/knife care kit to clean the finish on my 2 month old $3,000 pistol. The polish is advertized to be safe on ""factory hot gun bluing"". After polishing the finish on my firearm using the polish and a wiping t-shirt I noticed the finish was coming off. I just could not believe it. Because of FLITZ I am now going to have an extremely large repair bill."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"This is a portable charger, not a back up battery. The LED is Red when uncharged and turns Blue when it has a charge. The included retractable cord is extremely thin. Should come in handy during a power failure. It's more of a novelty item than a work horse so it's pricey. Most likely due to licensing fees. Still it's a great gift for the football fan in your life. Available  for many teams."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"The description on this erroneously states that it will work for .45 ACP.  It doesn't.  If you try to load .45 ACP with this the cases constantly become hung up when ejecting into the bin.  Instead you need the #45 shell plate.  I'm sure there's nothing wrong with this plate for rifle calibers, but I don't load rifle cartridges on a progressive so its pretty much of no use to me."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,Awful shoe covers. Difficult to put on and twice as difficult to get off. Not very waterproof and lined with a microfiber fleece that is basically a sponge for any moisture that comes into contact with the sole of your shoes. I got the XXL and it barely fits on a size 8 1/2 shoe without breaking the zipper. If you thinking of thrifty shoe covers go with a plastic bag. You'll be better off.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"Magnet is very strong for holding the bowl to metal surfaces, pull on parts in the bowl is not nearly as strong. I guess this is good because it makes it easier to pick up small parts, but I would have liked the hold on parts to be slightly stronger. I would also prefer that the inside surface be smooth (no raised logo) so that it would be easier to wipe clean after holding greasy parts."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"As Zebco's go, these are top of the line.  They cast really nice and are easy to use for non-fishermen (which is why I keep buying them for guests to use).  In freshwater they hold up well and continue to cast well, but in saltwater they turn into a pile of rust and the coating on the handle and middle section peels off.  They do seem to still be working despite that though."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"The plastic is of very low quality. I mounted the mirror, and rode my bike to the store. When I got there, I noticed the mirror had moved out of position. I thought maybe I hadn't tightened it enough, but when I took a closer look, I could see the plastic had cracked all the way through the support arm. I let the 4 1/2 star review trick me ! This is a very low quality product."

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"...I find that it gets weird stains easily.  I only use this on one of my clients.  The rest of the time, I have it in my closet.  If it rests against something that has print on it (think a box with color), it seems to absorb some of the color and turns this weird yellowish-greyish stain on the ball's surface.  Other than that, this ball works great and is great for travel."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"For a Schwinn Product these mirrors are real ""Clunky"". They only come in LEFT side fittings. They don't stay in adjustment on ""Ball-socket"" & they swivel around on it. You also need to purchase lock washers to keep the stems from rotating around. I have had other mirrors work better for less money. I can't believe  Schwinn put their name on it. (The Ball Socket Should have set screws in them to keep the mirror in adjustment)."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"not sure what Ringside is thinking. The cut of the bag is lopsided and bladders don't hold air. Replacement bladders are of no help as they leak. leak leak leak without even beating on them. Total inferior product with no quality control in production let alone the person putting it in the box to ship.
Medium Title bags are a bit heavier but action is great and longevity is good. I'm going to get a small Title as well."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"I'm a female with a short bob haircut. This cap felt way too small, and I actually had a headache after wearing it for a few minutes. I will be giving this to my friend's daughter to use, as I don't see how the one I received can fit any adult's head. Speedo's spandex/poly stretch fit swim cap is much better, in my opinion. That one goes on/off easily and keeps your hair contained."

The problem was with the bib shorts - the openings for the legs were so small making the shorts so tight to pull on that I fear the seams would rip within a couple rides. The shoulder strap material also isn't as robust as other similarly priced kits that I own. Mostly returning due to the size mismatch between the jersey and bib shorts."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,Not really impressed with this at this point.  I have tried 4 times to get the analyzer to connect to the app without success.  To be fair we have done this right before practice so we did not spend a lot of time on it.  I will work on it at home where we have more time to spend trying to set it up and I will update this post if I can get it to work.

Either the ground is bad or the thingbis designed by terribly.  I requested a return, money terribly spent."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"The point of being 4"" deep is because the mat will be used for falls not just regular tumbling so this being as firm as a moveable beam is a huge problem and probably explains the difference in price.

It also appears that there's Velcro to attach them in the pictures and I got two without Velcro."

So unfortunately, I never re-ordered it. I would have if it had selected the correct size in the check-out."

Still not great, May see if I can weld it on my Gravity Mountain Bike, some how. Bike shops don't even want to deal with it, because of the need to drill the frame on one spot, Too bad they don't make any with larger brackets, for Mountain bike frames! I could not find any body."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"The holster is really well made, it looks great, and I picked it up for a sweet price (goes up and down if you watch it), but I don't really use it. The belt loop is really big, I wear a 5.11 belt which is 1-1/4 or 1-1/2 in thick and there is still a ton of room for the loop to tilt in either direction. Kind of a bummer, but I can use it as back up when I can't pocket carry my J-frame."

I hope to find it tomorrow but in the meantime I wouldnt recommend it for walks, jogs or runs."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,These weights work just fine but Amazon shows a picture of a different more expensive set than what they send to you. They have a picture of a set of weights in a red plastic box that has 5 weights sitting in the foam rubber beside of the plastic box of smaller weights. What they sent was just the small box of weights. I could have bought this set of weights at Midwayusa.com and saved over $6. This is not the first time this has happened.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"I've really enjoyed using this mat and I get TONS of compliments on its appearance when I'm in class, so that's kind of fun. However, after a while the mat has started to become pretty slick and difficult to use which is upsetting because I will likely have to retire this mat or only use it at home. If you are consistently using it for heated classes you may be okay because the moisture helps with gripping, but for regular, non-sweaty classes you may have some issues."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"To be fair, I need to say my daughter does really enjoy this, however, I am very unhappy.  We have owned it for just over 1 year and the net as well as the padding is COMPLETELY falling apart!!!  I contacted the company and they told me I can buy a replacement but there is only a 90 day warranty.  We payed close to $200 for this little trampoline and feel like it should last longer than a year.  I personally can't recommend it."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"This item was purchased specifically for the item it was advertisec to fit - the Umarex MP5.  It would not fit the gun at all.  After some work with a file, I was able to get it to fit the gun.  But once it was made to fit, the gun's bolt would not function.  More filing and more custom fitting allowed it to mount on the gun, but it never allowed the bolt to function due to the tension it created on the receiver."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"Warning! This is a poorly manufactured inversion table. I had to buy two extra part at the hardware store. I am so disappointed. It is impossible to adjust the height (it seems like the rod is stuck somehow). The instruction manual has tiny pictures and it is difficult to see what the instructions means (when you try to look at the pictures). Also, the table does not feel sturdy. I guess you get what you pay. Now I have to take the table apart and send it back."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"I purchased this set for a trip to Florida.  I used the set on 2 different occasions.  The mask was a very poor fit and leaked no matter how much I tightened the straps.  The fins were the worst part of the set, the hard plastic on the sides of the fins constantly digs into the sides of your feet.  If you are going to use these fins, plan on wearing booties....  The snorkel worked fine. Overall, the set was a pretty big disappointment."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"This bore sight payes for itself quickly.  I have a Savage 220 slug gun, and the ammo is not cheap.  Using the bore sight probably saved me 8-10 rounds of three-dollar shells.  However, if you want to sight-in beyond about 50 yards, you're going to be disappointed.  Maybe you could see it's red dot a little better if you sighted in just after dark, but otherwise forget about it.  I'm still glad I bought it, but I think a high-power green dot would work better."

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"The brow piece on this helmet (by the photo) is TOTALLY inaccurate.

The brow piece on a typical Roman style Imperial helm (pick whichever century you want) has the brow guard AT THE BROW, about 1 inch up from lower edge and goes around the helmet stopping above the ears.

The brow guard on this helmet is flimsy looking, a bent piece of metal that would easily get smashed off and offers no protection to the forehead.

I would not own this helmet if it was given to me freely. Term it ""scrap metal""."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"I ordered this for my 5mm yoga mat and it fits perfectly. I didn't struggle at all after class to get it back into the bag. The two pockets are nice, but they are a bit snug/tight when the mat is in the bag. My other complaint is that the handle is sewn on in such a way that the mat hangs strangely when hung over the shoulder. Rather than hanging vertically, the mat wants to hang horizontally...all in all it serves its purpose but it could have been designed better."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"The material used to make this which feels like a plastic trash bag is thin. It could fit a 30 liter backpack but I don't think it would fit a 45 liter one. Don't even think about using it to cover a sleeping bag and backpack even with a 30 liter backpack. This item is more suited for covering your pack in light rain and when hiking on wide trails but I wouldn't use it if your hiking trail has a lot of branches and bushes close to the path, it could easily puncture it."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"Construction is ok.  Another chinazon company with a half dozen brands of the identical helmet to spread bad rating around.  I rate it 3 stars because all the Velcro pieces that hold the liner in, needed to be glued properly as they came unstuck on the first removal for washing.  The only way to know if it actually meets any impact standards is to destroy it and I'm not made of money.  I just now knocked a star off because I just realize they don't even claim to meet any impact standards whatsoever."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"Purchased twice.  The first lasted almost a year with regular use.  I would keep it my pocket at work to keep track of breaks.  The second one lasted only a month or so.  The malfunction seems to be that, with regular use, the battery no longer makes proper contact resulting in a blank screen or random resets in the clock function. I do sweat on occasion work so it was subjected to some moisture.  Ultimately, I purchased a different brand for the following stopwatch which has been working well for a few months."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"I have used these for about two months and they are useful, handy, and keep your hands cool. However, there is no coverage for the thumbs, and sometimes the bar will still rough that area up a bit when doing overhead lifts with a lot of weight.

Durability-wise, a problem I am having now is that one of the finger loops is starting to tear away from the palm pad. No problem, I can stitch that back together. But there is also a small tear in the leather on one of the pads. I hope it doesn't get much bigger."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"Someone posted that this was $20 at one point. At that cost, this isn't bad. It's currently over $28 and not worth that. It's very lightweight and is a bonus if that's what you're after, but it's also flimsy as a consequence.

My biggest gripe, though, is that the cushions don't hold the stock or barrel well. I built a rifle rest out of lumber and cut much deeper V notches to hold the weapon in place. The Caldwell cushions are much too wide and low. I have yet to find a rifle or shotgun that is comfortable in this rest."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"This bike does seem sturdy, but came with so many paint chips!! Pretty disappointing. Some chips appear to have already been badly touched up with not-quite-matching touch up paint, and others aren't fixed at all. I read this in other reviews for this bike, so I guess it's quite common.
The chipped paint didn't occur in transit, as the bike was very well protected in foam, cardboard and plastic.
The bike still functions and went together fine, but don't expect the paint to be in good condition.
I snapped a few pictures for examples, but there were a lot more than what's pictured."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"I bought one of these for my grade school age daughter who is on the local swim team.  She tore the cap at the second swim meet and I chalked it up to her tearing it accidentally with her fingernail.  I bought a second swim cap, and that one tore the very next swim meet when I was putting it on her head, and I don't have long fingernails and I was very careful with it.  I do not recommend this Speedo silicone swim cap.

We subsequently tried the TYR Lycra Swim Cap and that has been much more durable."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"Quality built, and will withstand typical abuse during the course of use. Legs extend utilizing gravity as they're not spring loaded, and do not allow for partial forward positions as they lock either raised up or turned down. The mounting base is quite strong, and occupies about two inches of rail but stays in place with a single recoil lug. The thumb knob used for adjusting cant and legs is rather small. On my unit the cant could not be locked, or tightened enough to prevent accidental rifle cant. Overall I rate the quality very high, but the features and functionality are a bit lacking."

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"I'm rating this item with one star, not for the quality of the product which
being RCBS I'm sure is excellent. However, the company from which this
product arrived from "" Optics Planet"" really, really sucks.

Their communications level is terrible and they had to be threatened by
Amazon with cancellation before the item arrived thirty seven days

Furthermore, this is only one of several products from Optics Planet that
I have been totally unsatisfied with. I shall henceforth avoid all contact,
communications and any dealing with them and shall refrain from any

If you ask me again, I'll really tell you how I feel."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"The compression shorts are of excellent quality.  After several uses, the durability and quality is not a question.  The protection is however.  The cup insert allows for movement of the protection, but well beyond what you'd need for competitive sports or MMA.  I have finished hockey games with this cup almost turned sideways because of the amount of movement.  I decided to buy the ShockDoctor Garter/Supporter to compare.  Garter/Supporter blows this out of the water in protection (and it also holds your socks!).  I now use the cup from this purchase with the Garter/Supporter and rotate the compression shorts into my workouts."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"I REALLY wanted to like this scope. I was surprised at how small it was. I am familiar with digital NV scopes and have a Sightmark Photon that I hunt pigs with and REALLY like. The Bushnell was clumsy (buttons are too close together, which you MIGHT get use to), but deer that I can easily see with my Photon, were invisible blobs with the Bushnell. I tried everything at both ends and the buttons to no avail. It looks great. It just had lousy performance. I would call the image at night crude compared to the Sightmark.  I still want a digital spotting scope, but this isn't it for sure."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"I really wanted to like this, but it just is awkward to fish with.

The action is somewhat like a fish in it's last moments of life, when it is just occasionally flapping around on the surface on it's side. It is weedless, so I can give it credit for that. Honestly I've had better luck with the frog lures from the same brand. The coloring and look of this sunfish are very accurate, but just know that it ""swims"" on it's side, with the fish hooks facing the sky and the other side of the fish facing the bottom of the lake (weighted), and will never ""swim"" in the normal vertical orientation."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"I am a world explorer and I wanted a mat that would travel with me.  The only thing I really like about this mat was it's ability to pack quite small. While I will admit it is quality and nicely non-slippery, I was not satisfied. For one it was too heavy. The ""high quality"" rubber material added substantially to the weight which is not good for a backpacker.  The other negative is that it had basically zero padding which is something I really want, at least a little of, in a yoga mat, even if i AM traveling. I guess I was just hoping of a better balance for the price."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"This is an excellent fly rod for the price, it is well built and casts very well for the shorter distances it is designed for. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a light weight, small stream rod.

Update 6/7/2017, I was putting on a new reel that is balanced to this weight rod and the but cap came unglued. I have reglued the butcap and I hope this works. I would suggest a change in the but end and the reel seat, make it a one piece ynit and not jusr a ring under the cork handle and another ring with threads on the but end that is just glued to the rod blank."

This isn't my first computer, so I understand how to install the sensors and magnets (and look for things like batteries that are DOA, which the sensor batteries both were). After consulting with both the seller and Serfas tech support, they concluded that the unit was defective, so I returned it. I opted to not do an exchange as I decided that I didn't want to hassle with the four tiny screws that secured the battery compartment cover on each sensor. I'm going to try the Serfas SI-30 (a newer model) instead (they fixed the battery cover design issue)."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"3rd time I've edited this review.  Beginner golfer, in process of learning.  Initially I was very impressed, but realized some marginal flaws.  The club, like many drivers and fw woods, is a bit too long for average height and wingspan.  The shaft is very flexible - dunno how it compares to ladies or senior, but you can see it flex as it moves.  If you buy it, make sure you close the clubface at impact and not just address.  If your hands finish too far forward and leave it open, you're gonna get a monster slice.  But if you hit it straight, you'll get good distance for the $."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"I purchased one from a local gear shop before heading out on a long road trip out west. It immediately leaked from the valve - with the valve closed, water drips out where the white pour spout meets the red threaded part. Upon returning from our trip, we exchanged it for another, and sure enough, it had the exact same problem, but actually leaked even worse.

I did not notice any leaking from the bag itself, though the plastic was very thin in spots. I was able to deal with the valve leak by storing it upright at all times, but it's obviously not OK to have the think leaking. I'm returning this one, and will find another brand."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"I have not/will not buy this product. It's is sooooo unsafe. Think about it, if you carry with a round in the chamber ( you're an idiot if you dont) and you stick a gun down your pants, what is covering your trigger? Nothing. No one plans on having negligent discharges but they happen. Number 1 cause--- clothing gets in the way when drawing/ holstering the gun. What if you get in a fist fight and have to roll around on the ground? It wouldn't be hard for your shirt to get wrapped up in your trigger and go off. Do yourself a favor and possibly save your life, get a real holster. Priority 1 holsters makes an excellent product."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"Purchased this for Christmas for our son for Boy Scouts. Hauled it out today to set up for the first time (they don't camp in Michigan winters). Disappointed to find out that it isn't a stand alone tent.  Not Amazons fault, it clearly states one pole, I just didn't think about it meaning that it wouldnt stand alone. Makes it very difficult for an 11 year old to set up by himself. Past the return window, so we will just have to keep it. Seems like a good tent, and we like how the fly goes to the ground. Also it is a big large for a two man tent. Hopefully he will be able to use it eventually."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"I do not own this rifle but am open to purchasing one.  The reviews are very positive, but some reviewers mention 'barrel-droop.'  Amazon even sells a device to bolt onto the gun to mitigate 'barrel-droop' so this must be a real issue. Reviews of other manufacturers' guns do not mention 'barrel-droop' so I can only conclude that RWS has an issue other manufacturers do not.

But if this is such a great gun, why does one have to purchase an extra device to mitigate what appears to me to be either a design issue or a manufacturing defect?  I would love to hear a real explanation from an expert.  Until then, I will postpone any purchase decision.

Best regards."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"I have pretty poor circulation in my fingers and toes and it's really difficult to find a pair of gloves that keep me warm. These almost do, and when the gloves and my hands are initially warm they work well. If the gloves are cold and my hands are cold (due to removing them outside for a reason) they do not work as well as I hoped. I bought them new but off Ebay for around $90 so I am keeping them. At that price they are a good deal. At over $150 I say look elsewhere. I know mitts have better heat ratings, so I might try those next, but I just like the feel of a glove when I ski."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"I have mixed emotions about this water filter system. I love how it is hung from a tree, and doesn't require pumping, but I did run into problems. I used it for a week in Boundary Waters, at least the bag. After 4 days,providing water for 6 people, the filter was completely clogged, and is incapable of being back flushed. The pre-filter screen was not fine enough to catch the ""material/ suspected tannin"" in the BWCA water. I eventually attached a Sawyer inline filter to the outlet hose which got me through the last 4 days. My Base Camp Pro did come with the new and improved filer, but it couldn't handle what I needed it to. I love the idea, but was pretty disappointed."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"The nylon is sturdy enough for our use.  The color was as stated and it does fit our table.  The only problem I have with it is that I was unaware that the corners had elastic.  It is like putting a fitted sheet on a pool table.  Our past ones have not had that option.  It was not stated in the description.  The reason that this is a problem for me personally is that it is really a two person job to put it on.  If you have two people to do the task, then this is a great cover for the price.  If you have to do it on your own prepare to struggle a bit."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"The pen is a very nice and well made (5 of 5 stars), but a little top heavy with the cap on top when writing (4 out of 5 stars).  The ink cartridge lasted only a few weeks (give it a 1 star).  However, while it lasted, it did write nice.  Biggest issue, finding the right cartridge refill.  There is nothing on the web nor their website regarding (1 star again).  I had to go by Amazon reviews on which cartridge will fit.  Bought them yesterday, will get them tomorrow, and will see if they work.

A company shouldn't sell a pen without either providing the refill cartridges through their company or easily identifying what other brand cartridges will work...major FAIL."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"Nice flip up BUIS - push the button and the POP right up - kinda cool.  They sit nice and snug on picatinny rail but a little wide bodied on the base.  The rear sight has notched center line that matches up with eye hole - so that was good for centering the sight sight and I was able to adjust sight in quickly.  You might want to snug down the screws with some lock tight as that the rear sight came loose after several rounds and these screws require a allen wrench, so bring one along just in case.

My main sight is a fiber optics and these are just backups and I am pleased with them for the money - not a bad deal."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"Primary pictures show items with no branding. I specifically bought this for that reason! I don't need to see the name of the company that makes my fork while I'm eating spaghetti!

These may be flatware designed for hikers/campers, but they are still flatware. And at this price, I'd expect their design to be more tasteful. Any branding should be on the back, in an inconspicuous location (the same as any 20 piece, $10, set of flatware for four from wally world).

They were also packages in a fashion that allowed for them to rub against each other during transit, causing abrasion marks. Rolling them in a simple piece of paper could've have seen them to my door in better shape!

Otherwise, they are light-weight, and they functions as one might expect."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,These daubers are pretty bad. I am an avid bingo player and go weekly. They sell daubers at the place I go to but they are expensive there. I was hoping by buying in bulk I would be saving money but it was a waste. First off the lid always takes the whole end of the dauber off so it's an explosion of ink waiting to happen. After you unscrew the lid you have to take the lid and push down on the ink pad to get it to click back in. Also the colors are more like paint so lavander  you can't even see the numbers behind. These things are crappy. I've ended up with a stained shirt from ink exploding and numerous ones I can't even use!
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"Shortly after starting to use this product I developed my first ever case of Pink Eye. The doctor verified that it was not a viral or bacterial infection. I couldn't figure out what it was and the pink eye continued off and on for 6 weeks (the first 2 weeks was pretty severe). I finally put 2 and 2 together and came back to Amazon to read all the 1 Star reviews for this product and could not believe what I was reading. How can a product this dangerous be sold as an anti-fog solution that you put next to your eyes? I threw the product away and my eyes have fortunately cleared up. However, I spent a couple of hundred dollars on new contact lenses and eye doctor appointments."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"Please be advised! This rack will NOT FIT my Nissan Frontier. The C-Channel tracking system in my Nismo is several inches too low, and the clamps won't reach it. Apparently this rack is only made for Toyota's, with their track being set close to the top of the bedrail. So if you are considering this rack and own a Nissan, first decide if drilling two holes in your bed is acceptable.

I'm not sure I want two permanent holes in my truck to worry about rusting. Plus, not all bikes will fit the same way, but the holes will be there regardless. So I will most likely return this rack.

I will say however, the parts are all well designed and sturdy, and I assume that this would be a nice rack, when it fits."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"Bought this to try for reducing wind noise while motorcycling.  The directions were clear, and the product was easy to use.  I wound up using a little less than half of the mixed compound for each ear, and it worked fine.  The thing is they do not reduce wind noise much at all.  Had much better results with the ""shell""-type plugs like eargasm.  So while the product did harden fully and form usable plugs, I cannot recommend for motorcycle riding.  Also tried them off the bike, and in comparison to standard plugs they do not block as much sound for other activities like mowing the lawn.  They are, however, much more comfortable than standard plugs as they do not exert as much pressure on your ear canal."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"Took this hunting last year in the back country to save weight.  The bag is tough to use in shallow water.  The source water was dirty and even after back flushes it was slow to filter.  It probably took me an hour to get a liter and I was squeezing really hard.  Bag did hold up well for me.

I think this would make a decent emergency filter or as a backup but as others have said, it's not a higher volume filter for multiple day trips.  I'll be using my pump filter to fill bladders from now on.

I honestly can't see how this filter is rated high by so many people.  If you used the straw, your cheeks would be tired before you ever got a belly full of water."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"This will probably meet your needs if not carrying it around, its quite heavy for its size! I purchased one from Amazon's Warehouse to save a few bus, in truth, it cost me more and is nothing more then a paper weight, as they don't check to see if there's a key in the package! Yes, they sent me one with no key, and expect you to pay to return it....How much common sense does it take to make sure a customer gets the complete package especially when the package is transparent with a place for the key to see in plain view....nope, just grab something off a shelf and throw it in a box and send it! Morons!!!! Isn't even worth the cost to ship it back, so beware.....DO NOT buy a item from amazon warehouse!!!"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"An immediate return to Amazon, on their dime. Let the buyer beware. The holster provides more of a ""generic"" fit, intended for use with several pistol models. That should have been enough of a warning for me. I don't know how well it fits the other pistols, but it was very difficult to insert my Ruger LC9s Pro. After forcing it all the way in, the trigger guard was only half covered, which is not how it is shown in the photo. Once holstered, the fit was way too tight to allow an effective draw, and there is no way to adjust the holster's retention. I had expected a holster similar to the one I purchased for my Glock 42 (http://www.amazon.com/Fobus-tactical-Paddle-Holster-Security/dp/B00PBJ9URO/), which fits only that pistol and has adjustable retention. This holster doesn't come close to it in quality or functionality."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"I have purchased several pairs of TRUFORM Firm Stay-Up Top Thigh High Compression Hose. My only complaints to date about them are (1) they are generally slightly too long and (2) they have no SIZE TAG sewn into the top band. Usually I buy a 20-30mmhg but on the advice of my cardiologist, I ordered this pair of X-LG.When the product arrived the box, like the picture was marked XL (which I have been buying for 4 years now based on my doctor's prescription). This pair of TRUFORM like the others I have bought in the past did not have a SIZE tag in them. However, I attempted to try them on and they are so SMALL  that I could not get them over my foot!.Obviously TRUFORM incorrectly packaged a SMALL in an XL package. So I will not buy TRUFORM again!"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"Nice fit, but mine wore out in less than 2 months of use!  I use these just over 2x per week. Already, the glove material is separating and flaking off from the hand pads.  See photos.  Now, I had a pair of bicycle gloves that lasted me over 1 year doing the same workout as these for my weight training regime.  When my bike gloves finally kicked the bucket, I thought, I guess I should have purchased weight training gloves to use for weight training. My next set was Champion C9 weight training gloves, which separated at the seem after about 4 months.  I attributed that to the low cost/low quality and decided to upgrade to the more expensive GoFit gloves.  Nope, these things came apart in less than 2 months of use, worst return yet...and most expensive!! Go figure."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"Giving this a 3 star rating that is based on a 1 start rating for the Amazon pricing and 5 star rating based on the product itself. The case is perfect for storing my various goggles (clear, mirrored, etc). I would absolutely buy the case again if I need another. But, the MSRP on these is $7.99 and you (Amazon) are selling them at a 20% markup. I love the convenience of Amazon but I'm finding that I am buying more and more at my big box stores for items that are priced out of control. For these, I paid the 20% markup b/c having no idea what the MSRP was. I only found out after the product arrive with the Speedo tag with their retail MSRP pricing tag still attached. Great, now I'm going to have to start researching pricing on small dollar items as well now."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"The description says it will get you to 120 PSI. In my experience, it's nearly impossible to get the pressure in over 70 psi with this pump. Good enough for triage, but not ideal.

Based on other positive reviews, it seems that three things are possible:

1. User error by me (I don't *think* that's the case, but i'm not so arrogant as to rule it out). I would guess I am at least slightly physically stronger than the average user of this pump, so I don't think that's the issue either.
2. Poor quality control (some people get great ones, a few get lemons)
3. Widespread dishonesty/pay-to-review arrangements (I haven't looked for evidence of this, but I have seen other unrelated products fall victim to this).

At $25 it's not a super value, so I am less inclined to cut a break. I'm not going to toss it, but I wouldn't buy again either."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"Maybe if I had standard size carbon arrows this might work. However, I use Easton Gamegetter XX75's, a large diameter shaft (0.036in according to my digital caliper). This says it can go up to 0.3in, however, I disagree. I wish I had posted a picture to go along with this but I do not. The sticky rubber holders were stretched too much that it made it really difficult to get the arrows secure. But the main problem was that the rubber would actually push a couple, not all, of the arrows out after a short period of time (~1-3 minutes). This would result in lost arrows while hunting. I had to return this. Still looking for a replacement....

Overall quality, I like it. Seems to be a good quality Limbsaver quiver. Never got around to mounting it since it would not hold my arrows. Would probably would fine for toothpick arrows ;)"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"This mount doesnt have much good stuff going on.

1) only docks with metal clips. Doesnt work with nylon clips most commonly found on kydex holsters. Its simply not wide enough so don't think yours will fit even closely.
2) I had to use a Dremel and razor to trim it down so it would fit a metal holster clip. And even when I did this, there is very very little clip retention. So when I go to drap the forearm from the holster I have mounted in my car, the holster detaches and comes up with the forearm.

I don't see how there isn't a holster mount available that is compatable with typical nylon clips. This one would be a good design, if it were remotely compatable. I simply don't get reassurance with this mount because the holster rarely stays in place when I go to draw. Its not a safe and reliable choice."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"This product is unfortunately junk. The construction of it allows the coffee grounds to seep out of the percolator as soon as it boils. I purchased this after a trip with friends that owned a comparable GSI model of camp percolator. Up to this point, we had been using a Coleman French Press, which is a great product. Upon opening the box, I noticed that the internal tin 'coffee filter' didn't fit as tight as the model I had used and that there was no 'glass window' into the coffee pot to verify that the boiling water is turning to percolating coffee. Taking this on another week-long camping trip in mid-August 2012, I used this. Really a bad experience, unless you like coffee grounds in your finished product. After 6 days of gritty coffee, decided to return it and order the other brand of product. I would not recommend this product to a friend."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"First, this toy is far too large, even at the shortest placement of the seat. My kid is TALL for her age and she can barely reach the pedals. Second, the turning radius is awful. We have a huge driveway and this thing can't turn around. You have to either back it up and do a three point turn, or get off, pick it up and turn it manually. How much fun is that for a toddler? She has never lasted more than 5 minutes on this toy and we all used to ride ours all day long. There seems to be a disturbing trend with Radio Flyer trying to ""nerf"" the turning radius of all their products. I have a Radio Flyer wagon with the same issue. You need a grocery store parking lot to turn it around. They're now ""safe"" but no longer ""fun"". I will be looking for another version that actually turns."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"I ordered these for a party.  I will not be re-ordering.

The image displayed is not the image of the item being sold.  These Ping Pong balls have 1 long continuous groove running in the center of the ball; the groove divides the sphere into two equal-sized semi-spheres.  The words ""Made in China"" are stamped in black ink on each ball.  They also don't bounce like normal Ping Pong balls.  This last issue would be a total deal-breaker if I had purchased these for Ping Pong.  But that is not what they were purchased for!  They served their purpose, and were inexpensive enough which is why they get 2 stars.  I won't be reordering, I'll just go to Dick's or other sporting goods store to pick them as needed.

Thanks for taking the time to read my review, and I hope you found it helpful in making a purchase decision."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"I ended up sending it back.  I saw several reviews for this knife that gave it rave reviews, but I just didn't care for the wave design.  If you don't want it to open with the wave, it was difficult to pull the knife out without the wave snagging something.  Also, it didn't seem very secure just pinching the tail to pull it out using the wave.  I have a Fox DART which has the karambit style ring on the tail which is VERY secure; however, the ring sticking up above your pocket when using the clip is pretty conspicuous.  I guess you would learn to deal with it if you need a knife to deploy that quickly.  I ended up buying the Delica 4 with the saber grind, and I LOVE it.  Plenty fast for my purposes, and no snags to cause it to open when I don't want it to."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"Removed the caps on the adjustment knobs, could not turn the knobs with my fingers, they were too tight, there is no slot for a coin or screwdriver.  Used pliers, crushed the flimsy plastic that the adjustment knobs are made of but I did make them turn so that I can sight it in.
I generally buy quality stuff but this time I gave ""made in China"" a try since I'm only plinking with my .22, but these old eyes with my tri focals can't see sights very well so a scope seems to be what I need.
I know I could have returned it, I know I can't now since I've used pliers on it.  No worry, I'll use it until something else goes wrong, then it goes into the trash & I'll buy a Burris, had them for years, never a problem, quality is worth paying for, I actually know that, this Simmons scope is just another reminder!"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"I have not yet shot with this scope, NOT YET MOUNTED.  1)  It took over 4 weeks to receive it from time of ordering.  2)  The whole scope was covered with dust.  3)  The objective lens had smear marks on it but cleaned with a microfiber cloth alright.  4)  When I took the lens caps off after the 4 day return policy had expired, much to my surprise I discovered that the objective lens tube AT THE END was FLAT for about 2 inches instead of round.  The tube is NOT flat anywhere at the objective lens itself, but at the end of the scope.  That is more than a drop - that is someone sending me a scope from China that was mis-manufactured and hoping I'd never take the lens cover off I guess.  Since I'm stuck with the flawed product, I will still try shooting long range with it and report more later."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,Nice scope. It's not led sniper that's just the seller. It's just a generic scope. But it is nice and shipped fast. I wouldn't trust the rings but they look okay. Just not my type. I will update it once I field test it. Other than that it's very nice. Can't beat $60 . I'll change it to 5 stars once I use it and it works. (Update I shot it and it held zero through 20 rounds of .270 would recommend it to cheap hunters like myself also picked up the sun shade.(!!!!! UPDATE: I would not recommend this scope to anyone. It holds zero but when you go to use the focus on the back lens you can move the cross hairs all wich ways just by bumping it. Now I'm afraid my  scope isn't zerod. It is very blurry. It's okay for a first timer or if you don't touch the focus. But other than that it's a p.o.s also it doesn't catch light well.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"I purchased these gloves thinking they would be a good way to combat the relatively mild winters we experience here in central New Mexico. It's true, they are better than nothing, but they offer no protection against water and very little protection against wind, and are only meagerly insulated; I would feel my hands getting extremely cold after only a few minutes in 35-45 degree weather. I would also call durability into question because the fabric they are made from has started pilling after only a few weeks of use and the strap holding the retaining clasp on one of the gloves snapped right off while pulling them out of my back pocket. Again, these gloves are certainly better than nothing, but are near useless if used around water, snow, or ice, and are certainly not useful for use around freezing temperatures. These are almost certainly more suitable for use a a liner for a heavier glove or mitten than as a standalone unit and I would recommend using it as such."

This gun feels very flimsy.....it's working fine, but I wouldn't give this gun to a kid, I don't think it'll handle abuse well.  While other reviewers claim this gun is powerful, mine isn't, at least compared to my Crosman.  I can penetrate cardboard with my Crosman from a few yards away; this gun can only penetrate cardboard at point blank range.  Also, the hop up in this gun is crooked, so all my shots deviate to the right.  It's consistent, but still kind of irritating, considering that my Crosman, which costs about the same, shoots straight.

Overall, the Crosman Marines airsoft rifle is the best one out there in the cheaper/entry level airsoft guns, so if you're getting one, get the Crosman and pass on this."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"I realize other people gave this item great reviews, but I believe they are incorrect. First of all it is NOT a pillow-top, NOT soft at all. The material they used on the seat is like a thick rubber tube, NOT like the picture shows. The picture looks like it would be a nice soft fabric, this is NOT the case. As far as comfort goes, my stock seat is better than this one (specialized comfort seat). Maybe the other reviewers weighed less than I do. I weigh 200 lbs and found this seat to be very hard, stiff and it became very hot in just 15 minutes of riding. it did not protect the sensitive area of my body (men know this area) and it began to hurt very quickly. I would NOT recommend this seat to anyone who weighs more than 175lbs. I returned this seat and purchased a Cloud 9 instead, which is far superior seat. I hope this review helps someone that is really looking for a comfort seat."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"My initial review of this was very positive. We like these very much. But my daughter started developing a rash above her lip where the bottle was touching. She has done this with other metal bottles without issue, even with her metal sensitivity. But these bottles must have a high nickel content or something because she is very clearly reacting to them. Now I have to send her to school with this bottle AND a stainless steel straw so she can drink from them. Ugh. I wish we had figured it out sooner. We would have returned them.  My original review is below in case you don't have a metal issue and want to know more about the product:

Easy to clean, easy to open. They have a smaller opening than many of our bottles which is nice, too. No problem with the tops in the dishwasher either (most of our other bottle tops have to be hand washed). So we are very pleased with these and bought several more after trying them out."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,Item arrived nicely packaged and in good time. I was not as excited about the item once I realized that the poles that come with it only sit in the holders. The package comes with 5 poles and 10 holders and a storage bag. You place the poles on the holder and proceed. You also get a link to an e-book that gives you ideas of how to use the product - which is a nice bonus. I was actually thinking the poles snapped into the holder but they do not. I contacted the seller and was advised that they did it this way as a precaution so the poles will just fall out if you trip or something. I personally would have preferred that they lock in but they work the same as long as you don't trip. As noted the e-book gives you several set-up ideas to use for a variety of workouts. It probably would take two sets to really get a full use out of the system. It is very versatile and made well.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"This would work fine for pistol casings but for rifle rounds ( which is why I bought it ) it does nothing to resize the neck. I bought a .223 die set to reload. I let a friend come over to use my press because I am trying to get him into reloading while I ran errands. When I came back he got the casing stuck in the decapping die. This had never happened to me so I checked youtube for some advice. This did not go well and the rod was damaged getting the casing out. I logged on to Amazon searched for .223 decapping die. This POS was the only one found. I didn't read the details that this was a one size fits all piece of trash ( we all know one size fits all rarely works ) Since .223 was in the description it pulled it up and I the unknowing unexpecting consumer ended up buying a $16 paper weight. This is my first and only bad experiance with Lee or Amazon. Buyer beware the ""DEVIL"" is in the details."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"I really wanted to like these as I read so many good reviews, and they look great when worn. First off, I have deeper eye sockets and always have had challenges finding goggles that don't leak.

After seating the goggle and tightening down with a firm, yet comfortable tension, these goggles didn't leak for about 500 yards. Then a small leak started, which i think was from the outer edge. Fortunately, the water didn't funnel directly into my eye, however it was a distraction. After pausing my swim, drying my face and goggles, and tightening things down even more, the goggle didn't leak for another 100-200 yards then water came in again. I tried several other times to reposition and tighten things, but this model just wouldn't work for me. Side note, I ended up with large raccoon eyes and a major headache from tightening things down for at least 24hrs after my swim. I probably should have conceded sooner :(

I hate giving a low rating as this product is very good quality for the price, and look fantastic, however it just isn't for all swimmers."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"I tried 2 from each container (4 total)

MATCHES - 1 broke in half, one didn't lite after many attempts, 2 lit but only after many attempts. I my initial and admittedly informal testing, I had a 50% failure rate.

STRIKER BAR - Unfortunately I don't want to try lighting any more because it looks like either the sandpaper striker is either getting gummed up by the previous failed attempts <or> the abrasive has already started to wear off...after 4 matches the striker is now smooth.

CONTAINER - The cap doesn't screw on/off - it has no threads or o-ring. I did submerge the case in water for about a minute and I didn't see any water inside, but I'd be much more comfortable with a cap that screws on and seals with an o-ring, like other matches offered on Amazon.

BOTTOM LINE: I can't give it 1 star, because if you can get them lit, they're better than a regular match...however, these feel like a ""One Star"" product...it feels a bit like a Bait-N-Switch to me. It looks like the good matches, but these are flimsy, inconsistent and unreliable."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"I purchased this watch for my wife almost two years ago. She wore it very rarely, as a ""vacation watch"" when we went on vacations where we would be swimming or snorkeling. The watch's description on Amazon states: ""Water resistant to 100m (330ft): in general, suitable for swimming and snorkeling, but not diving."" On the second day of our most recent trip the watch stopped working, apparently due to water that had entered the display. My strong advice is to not purchase this watch if you plan to use it while snorkeling. Doing some additional research, I discovered that to really be considered adequate for snorkeling, a watch should be rated to 200 M /  20 ATM. Watches, like this Timex, rated to 100 M /  10 ATM should be OK for light swimming, but not for snorkeling. Whatever we decide on as a replacement will be rated for 200 M / 20 ATM.

I have rated this watch two stars, instead of one star, because it did work for a while, looked good, was comfortable, etc., and because for light swimming only, it is probably fine."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"I also did not have the easiest time getting this watching working and setup to a display I liked. There isn't a display more that I like. I'd like to just seem heart rate and time. As for ""tapping"" mine didn't seem to work until I got frustrated and nailed it really hard, then it worked! The watch looks nice and feels fine for working out. The chest strap worked with the treadmill in my gym, so I didn't have to look at the watch to see my heart rate when I was on it. I found that wearing the watch with the face down on my left had made it easier to check my heart rate when I was active.

Overall I'd want a unit that was easier to use with more display options.

Notes:
- Tap the face, Tap is the not right word. I have to hit it pretty hard!
- Couldn't find a display mode that just showed me the basic stats.
- Not very easy to setup or use.
- Is reliable in reporting your heart rate once you have it going.
- Chest band seems to work with the cardio equipment in the gym"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"This is a cloth with what feels like some kind of gel in it.  It has a waffle weave on one side and slick on the other.  You wet it and it's supposed to cool you down.  But, I really just feel the coldness of the water on my skin.  As I heat up, it starts to feel humid and clammy.  I tried this on several occasions and was not able to wear it for longer than 10 minutes before it just became uncomfortable.  It's really just a cloth that will hold wetness longer than say a plain cotton cloth.

If you leave it sit out to dry, it turns stiff.  Just wet it and it becomes soft again.  I wet it and placed it inside the plastic tube it comes in and two weeks later it was still soft and moist.  I don't know what the long term effects of that will be.  Whether or not mold will start to set in.  So, if you're going to store it, I'd recommend letting it dry out before placing it in the tube.

It is washable."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"I purchased a complete set from Biolite two weeks ago. It arrived missing a critical pot adapter for small pot and pan use. In addition, while I waited for THE FIRM to fill the backorder for the stove and bundle purchased directly from them, they dropped the price by $30 but did NOT credit or adjust my costs billed to me. Nothing, absolutely silent on all fronts.

Now for the real bad stuff. The firm has no phone number. I created 5 very nice email over a two week period to them to various email addresses I could find. NOT ONE response. I went to Facebook and reached out to their social media host. No replies what so over.

Pathetic company, ridiculous operation. So so product."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"I initially mounted this scope on my AR, and have used it in about half a dozen outings. I found that I was really fighting with it, usually spending a good amount of ammo on constantly sighting and fixing. I will say, it is what it is, an under $100 scope, that I attempted on a .223 platform. There are hundreds of reviewers here that have been happy with this setup on an AR, but it just didn't work for my use (150 yards or less, mostly 100). When it was on, it was on. It just never stayed. You really need to have a strong understanding of MOA, scope centering and sighting, field of view, point of impact, etc, but especially with the cheaper scopes, as the adjustments will be crude and course. With higher end optics, the settings and adjustments are smooth and precise. I was able to mount this to my son's 10/22, and hopefully that will be an appropriate application. So if you are considering this for an AR, (just my 2 cents), there are plenty of lower cost options available slightly above the low end UTG products that offer much more."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"The price and comfortability of this mask were the 2 best things about it, which are 2 very important things to have in a mask. The negative, for me, was the fogginess. I have never used a tempered glass mask before, but I did the toothpaste treatment to is twice before use, and lo and behold it fogged pretty quickly and easily. Just like any other mask I have had. I expected it to work better than it did. When not fogged the vision is very clear and the fit is nice. I have an average sized nose, but a bit of a larger head, and this fit well.
It is possible that I do not know what I am doing with the treatment before first use, but I think I did things correctly. I want to recommend the mask because everything about it is great except the fogging, and to me that is a huge piece of what I would call a good mask or goggles. So instead I give it 3. If that was not the case, I might be tempted for a 5 star review, but 4.5 is probably more accurate. Great feel, comfort, size, and price."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"Well, when I first got it I thought I could just run to the gym once the battery was activated. Not so, I had to read and read some more once I found I couldn't just mess with a few buttons. I had to calculate my strides and weight in the machine. I like the durable plastic and I don't think it will break that easy as I dropped it a few times to see. But the case is a little hard to open and you must close it in order for it to work. I think it is nice once you figure out how to operate it. The accuracy is decent. I walked 50 and it recorded 63 steps but there's a sensitivity switch you can play with to adjust the accuracy. I will play with that once I go to the gym. Keep in your purse or glove compartment of the car as it may motivate or aggrivate you. I also like the time feature but you can/t use it if the case must be closed while walking. Overall a little complicated if you just want something to count steps or miles IMO. I did want something a little simpler for life."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"For the price, they are OK. You have to make some modifications. Consider these, from the factory, as partially assembled correctly. First, you have to grab a pair of pliers and flatten the hoop where all the lines come out the top. If you don't, they get snagged. Hard to describe, but you will know it when you see it. If that doesn't work, I will replace their open-ended keychain style loop with a solid metal circle of some sort (maybe a washer), or put some solder on the end. When the lines do get trapped in there, the sides won't open or close. The springs that open the trap are also weak. You can fix this by removing them, straightening them out to provide more tension, and re-attaching them to the bottom and sides. You can also make the trap better by wrapping the ends of the springs mutliple times around where they attach, rather than the simple ""over once"" method they use at the factory. And lastly, the lines are complete junk. Plan to replacement them with 40-100 lb test line or a stronger string. If you don't, you are lucky to get them in and out of the water a few times."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"**update**  So 3 hours after getting these headphones I was listening to them as I was charging them, and I got up having 1 side in a ear and SNAP!!!! They pulled apart with ease..... I was immediately saddened and in disbelief. Especially because I was loving them sooo much but now it makes me wonder if these are the right earbuds for me if they pull apart so easily. There isn't any safety or strength connecting these together, just the solder that connects 3 tiny wires.
*** 2nd update***** well after buying another pair of these and them breaking for no apparent reason especially after I babied them I went ahead and got some soundpeats qy7 Bluetooth earbuds and the difference between these and the soundpeats are practically day and night. I thought these were ok being a virgin Bluetooth user but now looking back a couple months and going thru these so easy I've realized they're garbage and a complete waste of money! DO NOT BUY THESE, especially since the QY7 earbuds are $5 bux cheaper and sound incredibly better and appear to be a complete better value with the sound,quality and extras you get with them compared to the bare minimum you get with these hunk a junks"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"I'm spending $22 on a chinese made medium sized microfiber towel because I'm about to start camping and be on the go and I want something that will dry quickly.  I could go to walmart and get a cotton blend towel for $3.00  It said to WASH the (blue) towel first as it 'could' bleed so I washed it in my sink and YES, it bleed everywhere...no harm done.

Why?  Because they aren't washing them in china, saves money and a step in the process = more profit for Sea to Summit.  Well, fine it doesn't bother me that much that I need to hand wash the towel.  It is amazingly SOFT and it comes with a cheesy mesh bag and has a cool snap loop to hang it, all great.

What SUCKS about this towel is that after I washed it in my hotel room (fancy hotel room with digital room temp set to 74 degrees) and rung out all the excess water it was STILL WET BY MORNING!  WTF!  I have been staying in this hotel for work for 12 days drying myself with hotel cotton blend towels and they are always bone dry by morning.

SO, the towel is going BACK!  What a rip off."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"What a extreme disappointment this kayak is.  I ended getting a hole right in the seam of the haul right underneath where I was sitting. This occurred after my third time taking it out. I was a couple miles down river from my car and was left stranded with a sinking boat beyond repair. The repair kit would not hold at the seam and I had zero chance of making a safe return.

I emailed Sea Eagle about my issue and had sent them a picture of the hole to which they replied the hole would not be covered under the warranty and there was nothing they would do. So basically I'm left with a useless boat and I just threw it away.

Even though this craft maker claims there is a warranty be very careful you don't damage it because you may be stuck with a whole lot of uninflatable rubber like me.

Also, the foot pump busted after the first use and I just bought a hand pump to use. The boat itself would constantly pull and never tread in a staight line.

I thought about upgrading to the tougher 380x, but after further consideration of their warranty, or lack there of, I decided against spending that much on something that may leave me in the same predicament."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"I really looked forward to getting these having read the reviews but so far have found them awkward in the following ways:
1. The fenders tend to warp easily meaning that if they follow the cross-section curvature at the brake end, they will be way off center at the mud flap end.  You can do a limited amount of adjusting but so far I haven't managed to get it quite right
2. Creep - be careful and don't try to get them too close to the tire - no closer than 3/8ths of an inch, otherwise with vibration the forward end of the blade will creep down towards the tire and several times I have caught it between the tire and the brakes.  I would recommend keeping the blade about 3/4 of an inch from the rear brake.
3. I use these only occasionally - in Colorado we don't have much rain, so they are on and off, mainly during the winter - they are easy to install, but I do seem to have to spend a lot of time aligning them properly.  Might be easier for someone who leaves them on for longer periods - I don't know.

I've had them for a couple of months - will stick with them but my enthusiasm has been dented a bit."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"I bought this for using as a hydration pouch but decided that in that purpose, it was far inferior to the Camelbak Antidote. The zip opening and closure is not as secure as I would like the opening of a big bag of water to be inside a pack while moving around. It's also kind of awkward to fill from a spigot, sink faucet or bottle. The drink port is a bit awkward to use as well but its fine I guess. The bag itself seems sturdy enough and not likely to crack or puncture easily.

However, after setting it aside as a hydration bag, I decided to use this as a component in a gravity water filter, (one that I cobbled together with some extra tubing and fittings and the Sawyer Mini filter, but imitating the Platypus Gravity Works) specifically as the dirty water bag. The big zip top makes filling the bag from a natural source like a river or stream extremely easy and the handle thing on top with some paracord or long Nite Ize gear ties makes it easy to hang the bladder from a tree. For that purpose I give it 4 stars, only wishing that it was bigger than 3L to filter water for more than 1 person at a time at stops or in camp."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"I own several Gerber knives, and overall I like the them, Gerber makes a solid knife. However, like most Gerber knives the steel used in this blade is average, 440 high carbon. It does not hold an edge that well and dents/chips fairly easily. The added features, i.e. sharpener/whistle/fire starter are nice. Although the fire starter is crap, it broke on the first use with minimal force used. The sheath is fantastic, more impressive than the blade in my opinion, very durable. The grip of the knife is also quite nice, comfortable and sturdy, no slip at all. All in all if you are an occasional outdoors man and looking for a decent affordable survival knife this is a good buy. But if your looking for a blade thats made of better steel (Aus8) and overall durability and blade retention quality and still at decent price, I would suggest the SOG Seal Pup. No bells and whistles. Just the blade but it's a fantastic knife and if purchased from amazon not much more expensive than the this knife. Basically if you want a knife that if your life depended on it, I would not go with this Gerber, go with an SOG or maybe a Kabar. Bear Grylls is a badass and there is no way he would trust his life to this blade."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"When I put on this paracord survival bracelet, I thought that it was a bit confusing how I should attach it to my wrist. I figured out that I had to put the black rod through the metal eyeknife. Then, I had to tighten the black metal rod to make the bracelet cinch shut. I liked the weave on the bracelet, it looked pretty. I chose the green and black bracelet. I like it better than the black only bracelet. When I wore the bracelet, I felt that it was a bit chunky. This is probably a good thing, because it means that there is a lot of rope for whatever I'll need to do with it in emergency situations. Some possibilities might be to make a trap or to stop bleeding. The compass was nice, but when I used it, it didn't seem to point to north all the time. I turned the bracelet 180 degrees, but the arrow didn't point in the same direction each time. The eyeknife is sharp so you have to be careful when you are wearing it and if you get too close to someone else. I was a little afraid when I was putting it on that I might cut myself. I liked that the Gonex bracelet is so multifunctional. I received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"This is my second set of these glasses.  The first lasted over a year before I decided to replace them.  Of the several different types of glasses I have tried these were by far the best, they fit well, fogging was minimal, and the molding did not obscure my vision.  This pair however only lasted a couple months (used about half a dozen times) before a plastic film on the lens began to flake off making them unusable.  I spoke with Amazon, they would not refund or replace due to it being over 60 days.  They suggested I contact the seller.  The seller it turns out is only a distributor and I was referred to ESS to complete a warranty claim.  I called them and was told I could get a replacement lens for about $20.  I told them that was unacceptable for something that should have and has in my experience lasted much longer than a couple months.  So after a few emails and about a month of waiting I did receive a replacement lens at no cost.

I understand that periodically manufacturing errors will occur even on the best products but it's frustrating when nobody wants to rectify the problem. Overall I'm happy with the product but very disappointed that Amazon, Sportsman Supply, and ESS were so reluctant to stand behind this product."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"These are neither a good nor a bad glove; you just need to understand what you're ordering.  This is not a warm glove; it is a LINER, and a very thin, open weave liner at that.  You can see your hand through the loose weave, so you wouldn't wear these for principal cold weather protection for your hands.  They fit nicely and are comfortable with good finger length, and the biosensors work well on touch screens, although I don't understand why OR put biosensors only on the thumb and index fingers instead of on all the finger tips.  The glove is very flimsy and subject to pulls, runs, and catching on things, so I would not think them durable at all.  They also have scratchy tags sewn into the insides at the wrists, which tags are annoying and look difficult to remove.  Mine did not come with the clips shown in the photo (on Amazon) that hold the gloves together when not in use.  These gloves made me think about which fingers I use on my touchscreen, and I realized that I use more than just my thumbs and forefingers (I regularly use my middle finger) so for me this glove does not have enough biosensor tips.  I'm not wholly down on the gloves, but they are obviously really flimsy and apparently not intended to be warm."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"I purchased a fixed blade Boker, and the seller sent me this by mistake. So consider this a review by a disinterested 3rd party who saw and handled it before returning it for a refund.
Unless a menacing look to a knife is all you are after, I find little else that this knife would offer. The knife is very tight and hard to deploy one- handed. The blade itself seems very cheap. Part of that is due to the fact that this knife has a chisel grind, (ground only on one side. The back side of the knife in the photo is just flat steel. No grind at all to produce an edge). One sided grind lowers production costs. Throw in the fact that 2/3 of the blade edge is curved, so you will need a curved whetstone to sharpen the blade, and you end up with get a knife that is unlikely to hold an edge long and that is difficult to maintain. I have 1 Boker knife (Arbolito) and am purchasing another, so I like their quality. Boker Plus is a low end brand for Boker with this Boker Plus knife is being made Taiwan. Speaking for this particular knife, I am very unimpressed. My 21 yo son had a similar opinion when I showed it to him. Personally, I have other folding knives that are 1/2 the cost and 10 times better IMO."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"This is a robust, well-made chain cleaning device of debatable utility.

Here's how it works. You fill it with soapy water or degreaser. Then you attach it to your chain and attempt to backpedal. The gears complain and water sloshes out from both sides because it has much more friction than you expected. You eventually find a hand position that keeps it stable and doesn't repeatedly derail the chain, then doggedly run it through.

The result is a clean-looking chain. The outside part. The inside part that actually matters is mostly untouched. This, after probably two minutes of running the chain in both directions.

Here's what actually worked: a bunch of cheap microfiber cloth towels (they don't disintegrate like cheap cotton towels), WD-40 bike degreaser, and Finish Line's ""Gear Floss."" Put WD-40 (or practically any other degreaser) on the microfiber, hold the chain through it, and run it through until it's clean on the outside. Then, for each big link, double up a piece of gear floss and pull it through. Do the small links too if you want. Total time is about three minutes. It's cleaner, faster, cheaper, and more thorough than this thing.

If you really want the chain to sparkle, spend a moment to undo the quick-link (probably) holding it together. Then put it in a soda bottle with ten or twelve ounces of citrus degreaser and shake for a minute or two. Short of an ultrasonic cleaning or soaking the chain in petroleum solvents and scrubbing it with a brush, that's as clean as it's going to get."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"The cheapest place that I found this was in Bed Bath and Beyond and this was on top of using the 20% coupon. That being said, this is not worth the price that was paid for it. ( hubby paid for it). With tax it came out to $87.09 This is definitely overpriced. I can see spending maybe $50.00 but no more than that. Unfortunately no one is selling it for less than what it cost, unless it's a used item.

This was bought so I could work on my Abs. That being said, this is not the most comfortable piece of equipment to use to do situps. Yes it helps with your neck and not straining it as you come up from doing a ""situp"" but if you have lower back issues, this will not help you. ....If anything , it'll make your lower back much worse. So I wouldn't recommend this if you have back issues.

I've been using this religiously for the past 3 months and only have 15% bodyfat ( female) and I don't see any ABs. My diet is pretty good ( fruits vegetables lean meats etc) but still no sign of any ABs . Unless I'm supposed to have lower bodyfat which I refuse to go lower than 15% to get these ABs then this thing is just not going to work for me. Lower bodyfat is not the answer for me- to many health risks involved with that.
 I'll give it another month and if I see no signs of ABS then this will be going back to the store."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"I've been using this on and off for a few months, and suddenly the spring button just snapped off, and now it's useless. While it was working, the plastic bottle is durable and can withstand drops. I don't like the circular ring because it kind of digs/cuts into your fingers if you hold it by there. Another difficulty is that the infuser part - has 2 parts - a plastic circular lid with holes and then the infuser where you put the fruit in. the plastic lid just sits on top of it, and then the two pieces are screwed in. Thus, it is easy to lose the little plastic circular part when you take it apart for cleaning. They do give you two - the purple smaller one and the longer clear infuser, which I personally use(d) the most because it could hold more fruit. Also, the shorter infuser required you to have the bottle full or shaken or sideways to keep the fruit submerged in the water if you drank even just half! There is a locking system for the lid - but it became quite loose after time. Remember, I only used this not that many times. Finally, the worst part was screwing the lid onto the bottle - it is easy to screw it on improperly - and thus instantly leaks - so you have to be very careful each time to make sure you screw it on perfectly horizontal, and that's not something I need in the morning if I'm in a rush to workout or just go to work! I would not recommend buying this bottle."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"For background, by trade I'm a professional mechanic, so I'm able to follow directions fairly easily.  This had myself and my father scratching our heads quite a bit.  The directions clearly tell you to put the ""height adjustment"" sticker on the WRONG side of the pole.  Also, installing the ""adjustment shock"" is fairly complicated and we ended up with the orange 'boot' upside down, despite several minutes of brain storming trying to interpret the directions.  They are written with a picture illustrating the overall goal of that particular step, with one line (presumably the most important note) describing what should have happened once you completed the step.  For example, instead of saying ""Install bolt (A) through pole and backboard, then use washer (B) and nut (C)"" the direction will have a picture of how those parts go together (you figure out where the picture is talking about) with note saying ""Ensure (C) goes on left side.""  Seriously.

Secondly, don't be fooled, this is a PLASTIC backboard, despite how the picture looks and how the description cleverly talks about it being shatter proof.  It is NOT glass, and it WILL respond as a plastic backboard does when a ball hits it.  Also, I've had it installed for just over 1 month now, and the rim is already starting to squeak/creak when a basket is made.

Overall, it's an improvement over the plastic (water filled) smaller version we had that blew over in the wind, but honestly I expected better.  I only bought it online because I live in a small town and knew it would cost far more to buy it locally."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"If I'd followed the fit guide they would have been a mess. Good thing I've lived with my petite self for so long I knew the larger size wouldn't work for me because I've got short hands. The smaller size is a bit snug, but not too tight. The length of palm from bottom of fingers to wrist is too long for me. They will be too long for any true petite leading to extra bunching in palm and thumb crease area. If you've got ""normal"" length fingers/hands they'll probably be fine.

The seam on the palm between the forefinger and thumb is fine on the left hand, but stiff, sharp and uncomfortable on the right hand. The padding doesn't seem like much, and there is still discomfort while riding, but post ride there is significantly less lingering discomfort than wearing none. The padding is in a great place to protect the meaty part of the lower palm. It seemed the middle of the palm didn't have much.

There are two very large tags in one glove, but I make sure they are folded up to the upper part of the hand vs. the palm and they haven't bothered me. The grey color is nice and the white parts help for hand signal visibility.  They were the best out of the 10 I tried on in a store, but there's room for improvement.

Still surprised that companies don't make goods in petite and tall versions of things. All the rest of the clothing fashion community can manage it, why not cycling?

Overall they're pretty good. If they were destroyed I'd get a pair again until I figure out that magical illusive well-fitting, perfectly padded pair."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"The previous spoke guard on my bike cracked where it connected to the spokes so I replaced it with this one.  The one that cracked was the original spoke guard that was on the bike when I bought it over 10 years ago.  It's not surprising that it would crack after putting a lot of miles on the bike, and over the years I suspect that this kind of material might become more fragile.  This replacement part seemed like the same style/quality/size (hard plastic) as the original, so I thought I would have no issue with it for several years.  Unfortunately, it broke at the spokes the same as the original one after only a few weeks and way fewer than 100 miles.  When I realized that it was loose, I noticed that all three places where it connected to the spokes where broken and it was spinning freely.  I don't know if all three cracked at the same time or if one cracked and the rest gave way because it couldn't handle it on only two connection points.  I don't think there is anything wrong with the derailleur or wheel or size of this guard that is causing this issue-- the bike works just fine and I've noticed no difference in my ride recently and this product fit perfectly on my spokes.  I bought two of these since they were cheap, so I will put on the second one now (or just leave it off and take my chances), but I honestly thought that I would lose/misplace the second one before I ever needed it because I thought it would be 10 years+ before I would need it."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"I have used this scope on two heavy recoiling .44 magnums, a Smith & Wesson Stealth Hunter and a Ruger Bisley Hunter.  Unfortunately the Magnaports on the S&W blasted the front underside of the front bell, but that's not the fault of the scope.  It just blasted the finish some, the scope still works fine.

That said, at least for me the 4-6x range on this scope is not that useful on a handgun.  I seldom shoot beyond 100 yards with handguns and the increased magnification is distracting unless I am shooting off sand bags.  I mostly use this set to 2X, and since I don't need the higher magnification I should have bought a fixed 2x.  That's *not* a criticism of this scope though, it works great at those magnifications, they are just more than I need.

EDIT: Well, it failed.  Something apparently came loose inside.  With it on 2X magnification it is now at least 4X, and the eye relief has shortened to the point where I have to hold it about 12"" from my eye now to see the full view.  It has suffered through probably 5-600 rounds of full power .44 magnum, but it apparently cannot stand that pounding.  I have lowered my rating to a 2, pending Bushnell's response on their ""Lifetime Warranty"".

EDIT2: Bushnell sat on it for a month, then returned it saying it met specs.  It's seriously broken, it does NOT meet their published specs at all.  Eye relief has shortened to about 12"" and it is way over-magnifying.  I will never, ever buy another Bushnell product.  I'd give it zero stars, but 1 is the lowest number you can choose here."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"My experience with the Kestrel 4500NV with ATRAG (and Bluetooth):

1) No indication that Kestral can be updated via flashing the firmware; if there is an ATRAG issue, you could be out of luck

2) The ""Gun Library"" software has recently become available on Horus' website (after missing for most of the year). However, the software does not appear to install correctly. (We've tested it on Windows 7 (64bit) and Windows XP (w/SP3)). The software is supposed to be able to look up factory ammunition loads from a MS Access database that installs with the software.  What you get instead is a ""DSN Driver"" error. So it doesn't appear to work properly.

3) You can finally download the settings, and you can upload them. However, you can not remove all of the guns in the Kestrel. Which is cheesy is you are trying to use the Gun Library to sync them.

4) Customer support on the Horus side seems to include many reports from people with much more time in grade, per se, than myself, of ignoring their customer base.

5) Kestrel, with generally makes great products, has an online support forum system that requires INDIVIDUAL approval of posts made. So, even when you mention something not really negative but without a positive spin on their product, the post doesnt get approved (that's not a good sign)

6) Kestrel has finally upgraded the software on their site to version 1.7, which seems to now work with Windows 7; this was previously not the case.

For a product this expensive, you'd think the software from Horus Vision would actually work properly. It doesn't.

Does the device itself work? It appears to. Has its support software been well vetted, no.

This review applies to an 4500NV ATRAG using Serial / Blue Tooth / USB-Serial communications."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"It ""ok"" but it depends om what items your putting into it, plus ""if"" it was put together correctly from the company. Overview:
I bought this Condor pocket pouch in tan and the NC Utility pouch by VISM in tan (see my review on that product page). The Condor pouch ""does have"" a lot of holding options inside of it, the only issue is that if the items you are trying to put into the pouch are too wide. (as in ""height"" ) the skinny pouch will not close. One issue:
The reason why only 3 stars, is while I ""really do"" love Condor products, this pouch on one side, has very ""weak"" stitching and you can see where it will fail after use. Really unhappy when I got my pouch and saw that. I have this molle'd to the other NCStar pouch to hold very light items, it ""may"" be ok in the long haul or maybe not with the weak stitching. I also put some ""krazy glue"" where the weak stitching is to try and stop it from getting worse. Other Thoughts:
One thing I tell people, is when you get a new bag or pouch like this. don't ""overstuff it"", but ""do try"" to fill it out. These pouches and bags are made very quickly, and quality control \ assurance slips thru as fast as loose stitching. When you fill up a pouch like this, you can tell pretty quickly if it is a good one or not. Conclusion:
So if I did get a good pouch without the weak stitching, I would still use this pouch for thin items like pens, paper and pocket knives and other ""low profile"" items that would fit. It would be nice if Condor customer service responded to my post. but I doubt that."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"This is based on the Iain Sinclair credit card knife. These ones however are generic and have no brands imprinted on them. I do not have an authentic Iain Sinclair knife to compare these with, so I'll go stag with this review and give you the raw details and ONLY this product.

I ordered these on Amazon from China in a bulk package of 4 for about $5 as favors for friends. Now in its packaging, already I notice the plastic parts wobble... because they are extremely thing. The cards measures 5 3/4 inch by a little more than 2 inches. They're easy to figure out how the use despite the fact that they do not come with instructions. There is a safety wheel that needs to be turned with a fingernail so that the blade can pop out. After you fold the blade back along the cutout, the other two flaps of the card fold together to form the handle. They will not pop out unless you force them apart.

The knife itself is about half a millimeter (mm) thick. This would not be applicable for any defense situation, This would however come handy with opening letters and tapes  (but not bubble wrapped packages or cardboard boxing). The entire knife is not as a solid as an actual switchblade or letter opener and flops around quite flimsily.

The folded card will fit in most wallets where credit/gift/debit/reward cards usually go. The card is lightweight and will take no more than 6-7 seconds for an average person to assemble.

Great novelty item, but not very applicable. I may buy the original Iain Sinclair model to compare, but if there are for your collection or as favors to friends, you might as well go for it, for the great price these are offered."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"I was really impressed with the bag when I received it and packed it out.  Took it to the range the first time with one rifle and magazines in the pouches.  Great storage, nice internal securing straps, easy to handle and overall great protection.

On the second trip I added the second rifle in the other main compartment side (compartment has divider) and thought what a great space saver this was.  Two guns one bag and all my magazines in the external pockets.  The bag has some cool back pack straps, in the next few seconds I realized how weak the stitching and hardware was.  When I hefted the bag to the first shoulder strap it immediately gave and way and fell to the ground.  It simply could not handle the weight.  The bag has four d-rings that accept two clips from each shoulder strap.  After inspection the d-ring ripped right off the bag, all stitching was pulled out.

Wow I was upset.  I really loved the bag and realized the d-rings are undersized in diameter and their opening in my opinion is too large, very small diameter and the weight is point loaded because the straps twist under the weight, very sloppy,  Even with great stitching it is a  poor design.  Definitely the Achilles Heel of the bag after more thorough inspection.

I like the bag so much I contemplating upgrading and having it better stitched.  Then I realized I did not want to put the money into something to fix poor quality.  It could have been a bad stitching job but I don't want to risk.  It is not easy repacking and returning, waiting for credit or replacement.  Think I will cut my loses and try another brand."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"This mat was delivered quickly and seemed to work well for me at first. I did slip some, which I'm not sure you can ever NOT slip because let's face it, sweat is slippery. So I purchased the chalk-like non-slip material recommended by the manufacturer and have been using this and have been quite satisfied with the tackiness overall. Without that, I'm sure slipperiness would still be an issue for me in a heated yoga class. Yesterday I was very annoyed to notice, after only having the mat for a month and a half, this mat is already starting to tear, which seems to be the norm with more general, less expensive mats such as these. I am very disappointed to have spent the money on this and having this happen already! I practice yoga typically just once/week but sometimes twice, but this mat never gets used for anything other than yoga. If I'm doing other exercises requiring a mat, I use my old cheap mat purchased at a popular local retail store that is crumbling in a similar manner as this one. I just flip that one over and use the other side for sit ups, planks, etc. I was considering more costly mats when I purchased this one, but it got such overall great reviews that I decided to be a little more thrifty on this purchase and took a chance on this mat. I washed it upon arrival just as recommended and am following all the recommendations for care to a ""t"". I don't think an almost $40 yoga mat should be showing wear to this extent this early on. I expected it to last a year at least. At this point, I have to say I regret purchasing this mat and wish I had chosen a more costly one. Disappointing....."

It's made of thin plastic and doesn't feel very solid. It seems to work okay, I just got it and tried it out. If you are thinking this is anywhere near as bright as a Coleman gas lantern, it isn't even close. In a dark kitchen (at night, lights off) it lights up the room, but if you say wanted to read a book comfortably, you would need to be within at least 2 feet of direct level light from this thing. After 3 feet or so bright illumination degrades quickly.

The dimmer switch works but feels as if you need to be gentle with it. I woulnd't really recommend this for any real camping due to its construction.

On the plus side, it claims a long battery life and the carry handle works well. The light is not blinding when you look directly at the unit, so that is nice for in the house. Provides decent lighting in a home environment if the power were to be out of an extended period.

Also, the one I got was a bit scratched up and had some weird dust? in spots on it. They wiped off, but perhaps someone used it already? Who knows, maybe just poor quality control. I ordered through Amazon fulfillment.

I bought this in case the power goes out at home, so for that purpose it should be okay. However, if had known it was just a Coleman label on there and none of the quality (clearly made by the same company that makes all other cheap lanterns and badged as Coleman) I would have saved a bunch of money and just purchased a no-name look-a-like with similar results I'm sure."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"Pros: 1) It filters tap water. 2) It doesn't leak. 3) Fits in LARGER car cup holders.

Cons: 1) Doesn't fit in standard car cup holders, but it does fit in larger car cup holders. 1) Have to suck REALLY hard through the flip-up straw to get water out. It's a cheek & tongue exerciser for sure. 2) The narrow straw & the amount of required sucking results in decreased water intake. Still thirsty after sucking so damn hard to get a little bit of water. 3) The filter doesn't lock into the plastic casing, so it constantly slips down with gravity, making a seal at the bottom of the bottle so water becomes impassable, so drinker needs to unscrew the cap, reach into the water & reassemble the filter several times a day.

Personal experience: 1) It's easier to suck through the straw by removing the middleman (the flip-up straw on the cap): unscrew the cap, detach top of straw from inner lid, then just suck from the clear colorless straw. The water is still filtered but then I don't have to suck as hard as I do when sucking through the flip-up straw.

2) The bottle doesn't leak UNLESS you accidentally drop it on a hard floor while the straw is flipped up, then the hard plastic straw may crack, including the peg that plugs the air hole. Then it may leak if ever it turns upside down in your bag.

3) I did accidentally drop it on a hard floor while the hard plastic straw was flipped up. The hard plastic flip-up straw shattered, and now it cuts the inside of my lips whenever I drink from it.

4) When it broke, I had just bought it and wasn't feeling like spending another $10 on yet another water bottle, so I've been enduring the sliced lips & hard sucking cheek & tongue workouts & reduced water intake."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"Ok, first let me say that I ordered from Western Frontier, and the MREs I got were totally genuine and as described, so that's good.

The rest of this is my review of MREs in general. This is first time I've ever had one. I bought 3 to bring on an over night hiking trip.

Pros:
They contain EVERYTHING you need to eat them, you don't need a spoon, fork, or even a cup (they have a beverage bag you can use just in case). They also contain little niceties like a moist towelette. This makes them excellent to just throw them in a pack and go.

If you assume 3 per day, they have plenty of calories to keep you going. I definitely wasn't hungry. One thing I wasn't expecting though is that most MREs come with a large pouch of peanut butter or cheese spread, so you have to be prepared just like.. eat a bunch of peanut butter out of a tube if you want to get the last 1/3 of the calories.

The heater packs work awesome and are really convenient. They're pretty light too, so they don't feel like a waste of weight.

Cons:
A downside of everything being included is that these are pretty heavy, and a lot of the weight is wasted on things you only really need one of, like the plastic spoon these come with. On the plus side, the plastic spoons are so heavy and durable that I'm going to put them in with my regular silverware.

Flavor wise.. I'd call them neutral. I eat lunch at a gas station most days, so I wouldn't say I have a refined palette. I'd put them on the scale next to canned food. Like it's not bad, but you don't really look forward to it unless you're hungry.

Overall, I'd say I'm happy with my purchase, but I'm glad I didn't go and buy a whole case right away."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"I really liked this knife when I first got it.  Pro:  It was my first spring assisted blade and I really enjoyed it.  Fast to open, with practice you can operate with only one hand (open and close), I like the feel in the hand and in the pocket with the provided clip, and I like the construction of the handle.  Very sturdy and has good texture to keep it secure in the hand.

Con:  Steel did not keep much of an edge.  Too much of the edge is wasted on serration (I know this is easily discernible from the picture but in the field I only used the serrated section once.  Usually it just got in the way).  Too much play in the blade.  Others have mentioned this in their reviews.  But even after tightened there was a little play and it seemed to get loose pretty easily.  But the thing that really bothered me is that the spring (as in the one that assists in opening) broke.  And since that happened, the lock does not stay engaged either (I assume that they are connected).  So now this thing is going in the trash.  The blade literally just flops back and fourth.  I do not even trust it to use as a tool in the always open position because the lock is unreliable.  Long story short, save your money, and buy a better knife.  I thought Gerber was good quality.  At least they seemed to be when I was growing up.  But I will probably not own another one.  Life expectancy should be more than a year an a half.  EDC tools should be more reliable.  My EDC of choice now is a Spyderco Endura 4 Wave that I also bought from Amazon.  Will post a detailed review of that soon."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"I should have trusted the poor reviews that I read here.  Many reviews mention that this thing just stops working after a few weeks.  Well, add me to the list - this was fantastic for about 100 shots.  Really great concept.  Sure enough picked it up on day #27, fired 4 shots, then  no-worky -  it stopped lighting up altogether.  When I opened it up, could press the battery down and make it light - but will not light when the cap is on no matter how hard I press the little rubber stopper.

Changed batteries - no go.  Tried putting in a paper insulator as shown by one customer here - DON'T DO THAT!!!! with one layer of paper inside, you cannot remove the batteries again - no way to get them out.

Thank goodness for Amazon returns - this thing is going back right now....  I'll have to try Surestrike or other competing product instead.  But buyer beware - I have not seen a product yet with REALLY good reviews.  Seems like they must all be using cheap $6 Chinese laser pointers and charging $90 as a ""laser cartridge"".  Shame on you, Laserlyte - for the $90 I paid, I deserved more than 100 shots.  Won't buy from them again.

Maybe duct taping my $6 laser pointer to my barrel, and just watching it for movement during my trigger pull will be adequate enough? I'll give it a try.

UPDATE: 6/16/17. Don't buy the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/G-Sight-9mm-Luger-Training-Laser-Cartridge-Gen2-w-Laser-Training-Pro-App-Brass/dp/B07115ZZBM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">G-Sight 9mm Luger Training Laser Cartridge - Gen2 w/Laser Training Pro App, Brass,</a>either - I just bought two of them - they will not fit in the barrel of the S&W M&P Shield 9mm.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"The SOG Fatcat that I received, arrived in a dirty, worn looking presentation box, and the knife had multiple scratches on the bolsters and ornamental metalwork (despite the protective plastic films). At $362. 19 delivered, this is fairly outrageous. I sent it back the very next day. If the Fatcat I received is a NIB (New In Box) knife, then it was carelessly assembled at the factory, without regard to scratching up the bolsters and ornamental metalwork. Honestly, this thing looked like it had spent time in someone else's pocket, amidst loose change and keys. If the knife did indeed leave the factory that way, it is a major breach of consumer trust to put those protective films over scratched and dinged up metal surfaces. In my considerable years, I have never removed a protective film from a new watch crystal, or cell phone screen, or even a new kitchen faucet, to find it scratched up beneath the protective plastic. I have seen this but once before--on Cold Steel Espada XL knives, where protective plastic films were knowingly and unethically placed over scratched and dinged up bolsters. I sent those knives back as well. Obvious defects aside, the knife is impressive, but overpriced. If you just have to have one, then have at it. But if you pay more than $150. 00 for it, dinged up or otherwise, you've paid too much in my opinion. I have another SOG Knife due to be delivered tomorrow. I can only hope that the dinged up Fatcat I received is an anomaly, and not the norm for this OEM. Over the years I have purchased a dozen Spyderco Knives, and I've never been less than satisfied with any of them. The same can be said for Kershaw. In fact, the $80. 00 Handmade Damascus Folding Knife from Perkin Knives, that arrived the same day this SOG Fatcat did, is both beautiful and ostensibly flawless--at less than 1/4 the price!

Based on the sample I received, I cannot recommend this knife."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"This was a warehouse deal item but if I bought another, I'd pay full price.  This had a scratch in it that I keep looking at over and over.  The thermos holds quite a bit of coffee for me.  This is a tall, thin thermos so it is easy to hold.  I have the teal color and it is a very nice shade.  The top screws on and has to be lined up perfectly to get this to go on and make sure you tighten it down real good or you'll get your beverage leaking out.  I usually put lids on so tight my husband cannot get them off and with this, even with tightening this down the way I usually do, it was not tight enough.  The top center has a small button to push  up or down to open or close it, that works good.  There is also a small hook inside to hold a tea bag.  I haven't used that feature yet but I will.  That is different and will come in handy.

02/23 update - I filled this up with coffee today and screwed the top on and the silver band split and there is about a 1/8 inch gap now in the top.  It seems to not cause any spill of the coffee yet, but we'll see.  Maybe this wasn't such a good deal after all.

03/08 - Another update.  This was a sale one day recently and I bought a silver one with a black top to take to work.  Do not buy the silver with the black top!  You cannot see where the opening is for the beverage to come out and I spill hot coffee on my cheek and clothing about 80 percent of the time.  Since I used this, I will probably have to make some scratch marks in the lid so I know when the opening is.  This will be better than a burned red face."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,negative,truthful,"It is definitely not as big and strong as the industrial cages you find at the gym, but its perfect for a workout room or basement at home.  The cage is relatively light weight, I can easily slide it around or pick it up and move it.  If you are throwing up any amount of weight, the entire cage slides backwards when you throw the bar back to re-rack it on the barbell catches.  It would start sliding on me, but I just pushed it up against the wall.  But the primary reason for only 3 stars is the bench.  The base of the bench is a T shape.  This is great if you are laying back as the legs the jet out provide support.  But when you are sitting up or using the leg extension, you are basically sitting on a rail.  It is wobbily and not sturdy feeling at all.  After two months I have gotten used to it, but I wish the bench was of higher quality.  The seat portion of the bench has 3 settings to incline it, but they are about a quarter inch apart.  The entire seat barely inclines an inch.  When incline benching its hard to fight the sensation that your body wants to slide down the bench.  Also, raising the back is not the easiest thing.  It takes some force.  And finally, the wheels on the back which allow you to roll it down are terrible.  I am 6'3 and I have to lift the bench way up high just to get the wheels to hit the ground.  My wife who is 5'5 can't get it to roll on the wheels.  She practically has to lift the end above her head.  We purchased a rubber mat to put under the unit, so it is a pain to slide the bench on and off the rubber mat.  The cage is great though, its everything I needed for a basement workout area."

Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"For $3.00 I got this to have a extra case, the shipping was GREAT. If u are looking for a real leather case this is not it but it will protect your tablet"
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"it's perfect for my 7 year old son, but you have to take the case off in order to plug in the charger.  all in all, I got what I paid for."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"This cable arrived DOA. It doesn't appear damaged in any way, but it definitely doesn't work. I tested it on four different computers and two different monitors, and the monitors never got a signal."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,Son loves the sound and they look nice but the leather like material around the ear pads has come off and no real way to secure it back.  Only had them since Christmas.
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,I loved the idea of this-that i could listen to my music in the car. it was easy to set up. but only works fairly. fades in and out frequently. also is easily broken.
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,Never could get this thing to work right. I hook it up to all the right connections; but get no response on the monitor. It has been added to my dust bin of useless parts.
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,I've only had it for 6 months. Half the screen doesn't even show up anymore and now it's not vibrating for notifications or when I've met my goal. Serious suckage. Will not purchase this brand again.
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,Just got this. It is not universal for ski poles. It does not fit on the slim carbon composite  ski poles. They don't tell you that. It also broke.
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,This router drops the signal on a consistent basis.  Too bad it started happening after my 30 days and I can't return it.  Plus one of the antenna's fell off during the initial installation
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,I got the 15ft cable but mine does not charge as fast. I had purchased the 6ft white cable from here before and it works great but I needed a longer cable and not satisfied. 
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,Disregard any review where the cable wasn't cut to make a run.  Every reviewer who cut the cable has pointed out that it is not Cat6.  There aren't any copper wires. This cable is junk.
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"Very imprecisely. You have to try very hard to make it work on the screen. Well, I guess the tablet was not designed to be written on anyway so the pen is an OK product to me."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"Works well, Two issues.  It is impossible to focus on higher magnifications without having the object being looked at up inside the opaque plastic cone.  Also the light is not dimmable and is sometimes too bright."

*I received this product for review purposes and I promised to give a thorough and unbiased review."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"Really like it; then it started to sound crackly at times like a loose connection. The sound would disappear, but I'd fiddle with the connection and it would come back.
Now it's gone -- no light, no sound.

Not very durable."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"I bought this for the TTL ... then I realized that the best results can be achieved only in Manual ...
The other problem, it doesn't support HSS which is a mandatory for shooting in the daylight (flash as fill)"
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,These are cute and my kids were excited about the color choices but we purchased two pairs and both hurt the kids' ears. They refuse to wear them anymore and we had to replace them with a different brand.
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"Adhesive isn't great (using in a vehicle where the temperature varies significantly).

The opening is also too wide for a single charging cable (iphone) and will not hold it in place.

Probably works fine for indoor use on larger diameter cables."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,We did not have a lot of success with this product. USB devices worked better. As I recall we had some setup problems and well and it's still setting in a drawer in a desk someplace. Would not buy again.
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,This Optoma projector died after 2 years. I've been replacing 2 lamp bulbs in a year and now the color wheel went bad.  The noise of this projector is annoying and horrible. Don't waste your money on this projector.
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"This lens cleaner didn't work at all... My other car's CD rom skips a few seconds of each track and I was hoping this will clean the dust and thus fix it, but nope, it didn't do that at all!"
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"The 'tulip' shape makes weird shadows, like a vignette, and you have to keep moving it until that goes away. Sometimes it doesn't go away at all. I would've rather had the round shaped lens hood but couldn't find one."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"I had previously wrote a 5 star review for this product. Sadly, after only 2 months the camera stopped working. I tried to contact the seller, but it appears that is not possible outside of the return window. Very disappointed."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,I wanted to use it as a signature pad but it didn't work for my needs. It appears to function well for graphics arts but I'm not a graphic artist so I'm not an expert on how it should function.
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,Seems to work most of the time I've only had it for a short while and some times I have to play with the plug to get it to work and the pie shows the low power working every 10 minutes
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"I bought this antenna in hopes of receiving more OTA TV. But ended up only getting about 2 channels that didn't seem to work half the time. I switched to the Winegard Metrostar 2000, and have had a lot better success."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,I bought this for my suv  I ask the the men who was install my alarm so he said the fuse in my car is too sensitive to jump so I still have in the box the camara working fine
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,Buggy when setting up m. 2 wound up buying a pcie m. 2 extension card which defeated the purpose of this board. A simple bios update would fix it but a this is a dying socket type don't hold your breath.
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"This hub works perfectly, but the seller is questionably dis/honest. After I bought and received a malfunctioning hub, the only fix offered by this seller was for me to buy another one! Yes it was more expensive and I feel ripped off."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,If you are use to a standard video camera....do not purchase this item.  I had a sony HD handycam that lasted only 4 years...but the picture was outstanding.  I may send this camera back if Amazon will take it back......
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"The stylus precision tip is very very flimsy. FYI, these styluses will not work with HP ENVY or other touch sensitive screens. So far, the only thing these worked for are my phone and tablets.

Hope this review helps with your purchase decisions."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,Card works fine until my Mac Pro 8-core goes to sleep. After that it seems impossible to restore USB connectivity. Sonnet claims the issue is that Apple broke/changed the USB driver since Mac OS X 10.6.  Read their FAQ before purchasing!
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,Review do-over.  Continued to ask for disc every time. It's obvious  that this product should be sold with a disc. Not solo. Never worked again question if the adaptor had any thing to do with it working the first time
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"case back cracked on corners within first week and proceded to warp.  The case would not stay attached to the ipad, it simply fell off after being attached.  The JETech slim-fit case is a much better choice for a budget case"
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"Right out of the box I couldn't connect, directions were no help as well as tech support.  I sent it back, it's cheaply made and won't withstand much use if I'm doing obstacle races, triatholons etc... I'll wait a few more generations..."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"Great idea, but way too weak of a light to use anywhere except a pitch black roan. Not practical for slide shows in a club or office environment. I returned it and spent four times as much on an entry model office projector."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"When I tried to charge it, my laptop locked.  My Sony laptop (Vista OS) never locked before.  I managed to un-lock it with no apparent damage to the PC.  Obviously if you can't charge the Flip you can't use it."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"The PS2 connection from my mouse did not fit all the way into this adapter.  The adapter nor the mouse were recognized by the computer.  However, seeing as it was shipped from China, the adapter arrived well within the time frame indicated."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"the only problem i had with this speakers is the battery, when playing without plugin the charger the volume will become less loud
, than when the charger is plugged in, other than that the sounds is really good loud and clear but lack bass...."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,Bought in december 2015 and its already not working. Purchased for my son to ise on his xbox 1. Worked fine for about a year and now the xbox just doesnt detect it anymore. Tons of games on it that he cant access anymore.
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"This lasted about 1 month and then started to come apart from regular use around my arm at the gym.  I had to sew it back together but it has been a frustrating purchase.

I used it with the IPOD classic pictured in the icon."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"I never actually got to use this.  It seemed to be charging fine, but after the first day, it stopped charging and is now useless.  Unfortunately the package got thrown out so now I cannot return it, but if I could, I would."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,The product does not work at all. Try to use it with every USB flash drive that works in all my other USB devices but to no avail. No sign of life or sign of light for any USB mass storage device connected to it.
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"Lenovo laptop power supply - plugged it into my Lenovo laptop and it shorted out my laptop power. Laptop dead. Returning power supply for refund. Sending laptop to Lenovo for service, at my expense.
I strongly urge you not to take a chance on this power supply."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,This didn't work for my son's coffee pot so I should have ready a little deeper. He is in Germany and I sent this to him. It works fine for his phone and laptop but I had to order a heavier duty one for the coffee pot.
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"Poor installation, did not apply well.  Lots of bubbles all throughout the screen.  I ordered another product from a different company and had to just take this one off and throw it away.  Just skip it and buy a different one, I recommend Coolreall"
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"Seemed to be ok as far as a tablet computer goes. If the sound output was better, it would be a much better tablet. You really need powered speakers or headphones to get good sound. It amazes me that Asus has not corrected this problem on other models."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"Avoid it. The top portion is made of plastic. No matter how I adjust, it will not stay leveled. You will need to get a separate ballhead to mount your camera. The mounting screw is too recessed. You will need to carry a screwdriver to mount a camera."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"The connector on the enclosure seems like it won't last very long and isn't very secure.  It would work well enough if I'm using it at a desk where I'm not moving around much, but I doubt it would work well using my laptop at an airport."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,The device stopped functioning after the first use. Changed battery a few times but would not power on or record audio when attached to the camera. The build felt cheap and I regret not saving a little and going with something a bit more expensive with higher quality.
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"I've already returned this case. The bottom piece would not say snapped on at all. The keyboard cover was great and the colors of the case were vibrant and really flashy. If the bottom piece was fixed, this case would be great. But as it is? Save your money."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"This case has a nice feel, but is rather bulky and does not protect it from falls.  As I learned the hard way, dropping your iPad on one of the corners using this case will cause the screen to shatter.  This offers no real protection to your iPad."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,I'm afraid it wouldn't last long - wires are too thin they should be made to be more durable! The main idea of buying this item was to replace the other set one ear bud of which failed after about one year of use because of the same problem ....
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,I purchase this sleeve when I purchased my Acer 15 inch Chromebook and it does fit the laptop just fine but because of the large size it should have handles as it is too large and too heavy to one hand it like you would a tablet in a sleeve.
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"This case is well designed for the original version of the Pro because it's single viewing angle matched what the OEM stand provided. On the Pro 2, the second viewing angle is very help, but the build of this case eliminates it as an option without removing it from the case."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,Amazon wanted me to rate this product but I have not had the time to use it in the installation of the Boss subwoofer.  The star rating is only because the computer system requires one.  Hope to install the subwoofer with the wiring harness over the July 4th weekend.
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"This cable probably functions properly with certain devices.  Between my Mac Mini and my Mitsubishi Projection TV, it did not, best I can see is because there is a sync issue that one or the other do not support.  The cable itself lacks shielding on the final component leads."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"Great sleeve except it's so snug that you wouldn't be able to fit the surface in it with the keyboard on. I have to remove the keyboard and put it on the back pocket. Other than that, I love the design, material, magnetic closure, and the designated loop for the pen."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"This extension cord was the perfect length. However, my computer was unable to receive power through it. I disconnected this cord and reinserted the original power cord and the PC powered right up. I added the Tripp Lite cord back and no power again. Maybe I just received a bad cord."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"Bought this mostly for ham bands listening due to its ability to capture SSB which does actually work well.
One down-side is it only contains 80, 40, 20, and 15 meter ham bands.
It does however pick-up both CW and SSB signals.
I wonder now however, if I should made the investment in ham receiver."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"Does not have the infrared leds as was pictured.
Has 9 hours of recording time using a 32GB SD class 10.

I like the layout of the function buttons, much easier to navigate than some competitors cams.

This will make a useful addition to my video / audio recording capabilities.

Thanks again Amazon for quality and value."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,It works out of the box. I was happy for a while until I pause the music and notice the massive static white noise this device is generating in the background. Then I disconnected the receiver from my speaker. My speaker is quiet again. I was hoping for better and returned it soon.
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"I want to love it, but FM has too much static. An antenna connector would be nice. I cant read the markings on the buttons and they are dirty already showing on the orange rubber. The mini sound card slot does not work. These problems are just mine, they should not bother other people,"
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,Serves it's purpose but we actually took the plastic piece off that covers the lens because my daughter felt like it was making her pictures more blurry and unclear. The only reason she wanted it was for the selfie mirror anyway to make sure that she would be getting her face in the picture.
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,This worked it syncs with my phone but short of it ringing when my phone rings that all it was good for. It did not sync with my calendar and when someone calls their name dose not come up on their phone number. So I gave to my 6 year old to play with.
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,Was a bit cumbersome to use. Didn't realize I needed the battery pack that stored more charge. Two fully charged batteries died within 10-15 mins of use. I can't totally fault to mount but wish there was some kind of indicator on the adapter to let operator know how much charge left in battery.
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"Only a little moisture shuts these down, and the earpieces need replacement immediately for comfort.  They do sound good and are loud.  The changeable chamber caps do make an incredible difference.  I would suggest Sony or Klipsch earpieces and dry ear canals.  For a workout these should be rated no stars."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,Got it to work finally. Can't hear much if any difference. First tried it on cheap FM radio and all I got was static and hisses. Then tried it on Kindle Fire and could hear no difference. On mp3 player maybe some volume but hard to really tell. Bottom line I can not-repeat-not recommend this.
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"Very nice radio, except I can't see it during the day time.  The glare is unbelievable and it's so dim it can hardly be seen.

At night it's great, if not a little too bright.  The dim adjustments are not adequate for day/night.

Other than that it's a great sounding radio with plenty of features."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,The SensorWand 14mm has a straight shape that makes it difficult to secure a PecPad on it. Similar wands from other vendors have a waist. Put a tape over pecpad around the waist line and pecpad does not slide. But with this wand pec pad has a tendency to slide off and quickly gets loose.
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,This is my second Rockville purchase and both seem to be decent quality. However this unit seemed to be beat up slightly and came with no instructions. Possibly used. The unit is lighter than I expected but definitely added extra power!  I've attempted to contact customer service several times with no success and is discouraging.
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"I have had the standard  charger for three years. It works. It also works in Europe with a plug adapter . No transformer needed.
This tip does not work on the iPad . It fits perfectly but only works  on the iPods and a few phones. Check the other reviews.
iPad requires another transformer. Be careful."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,After having this modem for eight months; the ethernet started dropping out. Running a speedtest  showed the upload coming up with an error or extremely slow speed which would drop the ethernet. Ordered a new modem ( another TP-Link) and it acted the same way. Finally ordered a Motorola modem and my LAN works fine.
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"Be Careful - this will not work with your Toyota if you have the Navigation system.  The Navigation disc in most Toyota cars use the port on the back to connect the DVD player (data) to your radio.  Therefore, there is no place to plug this in....  Recommend calling them first before ordering."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"It is a bit more light weight than I thought it would be, all in all, it is a very sturdy tripod. Although, there was an excess amount of lubricant on it when it first came. I use this with my canon T3i and am able to add a mount with an LED light and mic to."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"I have Senn 598's which are open-back, and I bought the 439's fully expecting them to be inferior in all ways but bass (since they are closed back). However, even in the low frequencies these headphones were significantly inferior. They may shine on their own, but they just can't compete with 598's. I ended up returning them."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"Whether Amazon, the third party retailer or Western Digital, this product does NOT play Netflix. I quote: ""Plus, enjoy access to your Netflix unlimited membership and other premium content.""

The closest you can get to Netflix is Youtube and Facebook. I wanted to like this device, I really did. In the end, I am returning it for something better."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"My car fails and doesn't have an audio input so to not listen to the terrible radio where I live, I've made a bunch of CDs (yes it took me back to my teenage years!).

This fits plenty of CDs but it didn't really fit my trailblazer visor. I made it work but sometimes one of the straps slips off."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"From the first time I turned this thing on, it skitzed out. Jumping screens and buttons without even touching the tablet at all. Won't connect to the wireless connection that I know is working because I'm using my iPad on that connection to type this. Even for the money, it's crap. Spend a little more and get something better."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"Description says that it works with 7 to 10 inch devices.  I tried putting an 8in Dell Venue into the stand and it was too narrow to be held by the arms in portrait mode, and in landscape the arms do not open enough to allow the tablet to fit in.

It does work well with a 10"" device though."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,It worked on Windows 10.  Software was mehh.  Unfortunately it can only output at 480P and I needed a 16:9 aspect ratio for my purposes.  Ultimately had to go with another solution but it was cheap and worked well for what it was.  Hardly any latency in preview modes on various capture software I tried out.
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,It is okay due to its low price point. It does what it wants to do but the main issue is the white rings. After constant use the white rings loose attachment to the legs and fall off. I recommend saving up a little more to get a Joby Gorilla Pod. However this is still a wonderful few time use product!
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,Very poor documentation. Even on-line videos aren't very easy to understand. Whoever packed my router broke one of the antennas. After working on it for 8 hours. I reset it to factory defaults. I also updated the firmware. Finally got it to work-not very well though. I thought it would be better. I'll never buy from this seller again. Buyer beware.
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"This unit was good for a bit.  The overall construction needs reworked as after only two weeks the stand snapped off, broke, not to be repaired or refitted.  The shell itself is of nice material to absorb impact during a fall.  Ok for the price but needs to be re-engineered to put a better quality stand on it."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"Nice form factor, and well, I guess it does function. Otherwise, it's just absolute junk. Speakers are garbage. Stylus makes every record sound like a 78 played during the Great Depression.

This should be listed as being ""for children only"". On the other hand, the sound is so bad, real audiophiles would consider that abuse. Avoid if you don't like complete junk."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"I purchased both the CD and DVD size.
The lids do not fit well as they are too big, really big.
In my opinion, excessive care is required in handling the boxes, otherwise snaps can come apart and the contents spills out.
I really wanted these to be good but I ended up throwing them away and now I use conventional plastic storage boxes."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"I am on my 3rd set. They work well until one of the wires break which only takes a few months. You may ask why I continue to buy them, well, the double the price alternatives don't last any longer, nor do they sound any better. The band on these fit my head better than the more expensive Sleep Phones as well."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"These look so real it freaks visitors out, out of the four units only three had led lights that worked when I installed them.  After four weeks two are still working.  I put fresh batteries in them but still only two still have the red LED working.  If all the LEDs were working I would give them five stars."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"Pros: The cable worked and it is very cheap.

Cons: There is a very noticeable fuzziness compared with HDMI. When I plugged in the VGA the image and set the appropriate resolution the image looked horrible. I then tried HDMI and fonts and images are crisp. This VGA is basically unusable.

I am using this with my PC and a Samsung display at 1920x1080."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"CD player died after 3 years of very light usage. I suppose that's just how things are being made these days (My CD walkman from the 90s still works) but I'm extremely disappointed that I paid $50 for something that should've cost me $20 (No battery backup? Really?) had horrible quality speakers, and was extremely bulky, only to have it break so soon."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"I am getting to hate them even though I have 3. As noted by others they can give a false open reading. This is not good since it is designed to trigger other functions in a system. I have had other Aeon products go stupid so if your playing there kinda cool. If it is a critical application, just don't do it yet."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"I didn't like this all to well. It just had a slow reaction whenever I made any kind of move with the mouse (and yes I did every thing on my part to insure the bluetooth and settings where on point). I only gave this 3stars because I did buy this as a used mouse, I guess with any product never buy used......"
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,This card stopped working after 8 months.  I could no longer write to it. I could not format it any longer either. PNY did do an RMA on the device but because of sensitive information that I stored on the device I could not return it. I shredded the device and decided not to trust PNY for any of my memory needs.
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,not sure how i feel about these.... not sure if i want to keep or smash with hammer.... my ip security cameras seem to have a really hard time staying connected. my router alone has no issues however but the router cannot reach all four corners of the house. nothing else is connected to these extenders so it should have optimal signal and bandwidth.
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"With most new devices (including the Fire) being made with gorilla glass, these screen protectors are an utter waste. Sure it may reduce some glare and smudges, but the glare reduction isn't that significant. And your money would be better spent on a nice microfiber cloth (which can also be used for other cleaning purposes) to clean the screen when it does get smudged."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,I bought this unit for the bedroom. I was looking for something that would work with my Ipod. This one does as advertised but only using the original Ipod cord. I tried a USB extension and a 30 pin extension. Neither would work. In the end I used the 3.5mm connection. Other than this annoyance I like the unit. Good value for the price.
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"It worked as advertised, decent range, good sound, easy setup.  after almost two years it started making a horrible hissing sound when a device connected to it.  should I be happy that this lasted that long?  considering how cheaply everything else is made these days maybe so, but still not satisfied that now I need to shell out again for a replacement."

is that the new way of doing business/manufacturing - without any trace of different design angle?!"
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"All the zippers have broken off. Awful build quality. Poorly organized. Both the worst backpack AND the worst laptop bag I've ever owned.

Also, there is basically zero extra room in the bag. You have space for a large laptop, and maybe a power brick. A couple pens, if you're lucky.

Overall, it's just awful. I hate this thing and wish I'd never spent money on it."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"This is part of an alarm system and you need one if you have a garage door.
The plunger needs to be set different,there is no need for it to have to good as far up in the unit as it does.
You have to get it set so it pushes all the way up. There is no lee/way on this.
I got it ok after three tries."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"Probably is better, but unfortunately there is nothing to compare. First, glued matte film stylus so slow. The corners and edges have to poke several times to get the result (can, of course, is the property of the film is). Second, the style is very rough, I would like in thinner. In general, the first experience with the use of this gadget is not impressed."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"The clip on this tripod is EXTREMELY tight, and is EXTREMELY CHEAP. i.e. two exposed metal bars. Imagine two exposed metal bars clamping onto your iPhone. Right, it will damage your phone as it did to my iPhone 6+. The clips on this tripod left two permanent indentations on my iPhone! WTF. Ruined my otherwise perfect iPhone from a $15 tripod...

AVOID THIS PRODUCT AT ALL COSTS."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,These speakers cause a performance issue in my PC.  When they are even in the room performance drops down significantly and many applications will not even work.  It fried one of my hard drives.  Altec says nothing is wrong with them even though they are much farther then 3 feet away from the hard drives.  Stay away from them at all costs.
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"This thing was lame. It didn't even work when we got it. It's really light weight and feel like it's cheap. We ended up going to Best Buy to by a different one that would do the job right. The bad thing is we waited too long and when we wanted to send this thing back, it was already too late to get a refund."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"The fit is alright but the clips are not keeping the earbuds well inside the ear. As a consequence you get a lot of the outside noise which makes the sound quality very poor in noisy environment (even when running on a treadmill). People will also hear what you are listening too. So except if you're at home or in a quiet environment, forget about these earphones."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"The grip isn't tight enough for an iPad that isn't in a case, also the unit can rattle while driving. Finally, I find that my toddler constantly kicks the unit when an iPad isn't installed. More than once she managed to turn and screw off the back with her foot. A better system would hold the screen between the seats away from toddler feet and rattle less."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,I am ashamed to say that I was enough of a sucker to have gone through three of these cassette adapters. The sound quality was terrible and for some odd reason the cables split exposing frayed wiring that eventually breaks and severing the connections also the tape mechanisms constantly make clicking and snapping sounds while in operation. I do not recommend this product to anyone. Try Sony's adapters.
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"They look tough and I may be a special case...

I've had these got less than a month an use then when I ride my Harley... They are plugged into my phone sitting in my pocket. Occasionally  I lean or put pressure on the jack, an now they are losing connection when moved so they are no longer useful in situations where my phone is getting moved around."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"After moving to a new apartment, my radio reception was really poor, so I purchased the Terk FM+ indoor antenna.  While installing it, I found two things: 1) my existing (basic wire) antenna was dramatically improved by wiggling/adjusting where it connects to the stereo; 2) this Terk antenna created regular bursts of static which I found intolerable.  So, I'm not using it and do not recommend it."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,The slip on case slips off very easily. The screen protector did not stay on very well and made it difficult to use the touch screen. I would not trust this to hold the ipod while doing any type of physical activity other than walking. I tried to use it skiing and almost lost it. I liked the look and feel but it was a total waste for my purposes.
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"I feel like it should be a 2.5 star rating.

Pro's:
It's a great little keyboard for the tablet.
The cover was pretty good, solid.

Cons:
The material falls apart easily. I barely had it a week and the magnetic piece material that keeps it closed was coming off and after a few more days fell off.
Didn't fit my tablet very well.

I liked it as a cover - but it fell apart way to soon."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,Tho is a really handy tool and I can recommend it more if you have a GoPro. It does have one down side. The lag make it cumbersome for follow filming. It's about a second behind and it's slow to start recording when paired with the GoPro. It great for setting up shots for recording and wireless recording but I would suggest getting an hdmi monitor for real time follow filming
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"Fast delivered, easy to work on, easy to setup on internet. Only 4 ""CAUTION"" comments: Don't have HDMI connector. The DVR body is huge (like old model of 1998 DVR generation). The view program for cellphone (Eseenet+), also old, to view 24 cameras you have to see 4 at the time. To finalize; for a product ""H.264 CIF/D1 HDMI eSATA DVR"" the view on flat TV the image was really damage."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"I read a review here that said the item worked for their Infinity Basslink. I purchased this for my Infinity Basslink and it did not work. Thought it may be a defective unit so I returned it for another. Still doesn't work. The Basslink recognizes there is a remote and cuts the gain, but doesn't recognize any signals from the remote itself.  The Basslink uses 4 wires, this item has 6."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"I used the batteries for a motion sensor in the entryway of our store.  The batteries lasted a few weeks and are all dead after just one use.  Utter trash.

Edit: after replacing the batteries with Amazon Basics batteries, the charger refused to charge them at all and gives the red light of doom for each and every battery you try to recharge. Truly one of the worst products I've ever purchased."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"This watch had a lot of issues.  It was not waterproof, and the first time I took a shower with mine it died.  I could have just gotten a defective product, but the fact that after installing the smartwatch app that my phone detected it as malware.... you get the idea. it had tons of issues. I would have been better off getting a cheap $5 ""Dumb"" watch than this watch."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"After about 4 months of sporadic problems, I've given up and gone to Netgear's MIMO. This device has been problematic every time the power was recycled. I've done complete resets using the reset button on the back (10 seconds) and the wireless, DHCP just don't work anymore. Can't even access the web based administration page using the 192. 168. 1. 1 address. When it worked range was good, but I have to recomend the Netgear at this point. [."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"Used this to splice join together two audio cables and started to wonder why my music sounded so strange.  A little bit of testing showed that this coupler was outputting a mono signal instead of a stereo signal.  Both speakers were getting sound but it was from the same channel, the other channel was being left behind.  I had to go out to an electronics store to get one that worked correctly."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"This is horrible. I bought it to use with a Blu-Ray player I have. I hadn't gotten around to using it until now (past the returnable date) and discovered it won't work. The blu ray drive slipped in no problem, but when I plug it into the computer, it just spins and the computer doesn't recognize it. I thought it might be the driver, so I swapped it with another. Same problem. Not worth the effort."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"This is one of the WORST consumer electronic devices ever made. Most of the time, it does not work. Calls get cut off. Calls don't go through. Customer service is the pits--totally ineffective and no one has ""authority"" to address consumers' problems. They insult your intelligence. Look elsewhere for VOIP. UPDATE. It took 16 days for Ooma to send a replacement for a defective unit under warranty.  That's 15 days linger than it should have taken."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"The first adapter I bought popped and died. They were very prompt and friendly about giving me a replacement. The second worked for a while, but now has to be held in specific orientation to work. I have a standard adapter from Lenovo that I use interchangeably so I don't think it is the way I use it. If you plan on moving the adapter around any, I would suggest you buy the better quality adapter from Lenovo."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,The only thing I hate in a set of headphones is when they are designed with the right ear plug being the main (long) wire and the left ear plug is a shorter wire that comes out from the main right wire. This is a design feature that is so incredibly uncomfortable to me that I had to throw these right into the junk drawer. I wish the manufacturer would have stated this. What a waste of money.
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"Speed is fine and all, but sometimes it 'vanishes' from my Macbook and I have to reinstall the drivers.  I'm not talking about after an OSX upgrade or patch, just one day it's there and the next it's not.  I have this on a USB hub on my monitor that gets moved from the Macbook to a windows system and it works on both which is what you would expect.  Never has issues under windows 10."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"Couldn't get it to work. After reading page after page of forum complaints all complaining they couldn't get the k150 to reset correctly, one guy said this might be a far east clone of a k150 that doesn't work correctly.

13 dollars straight into the garbage can.

Just get a pickit 3, its not that much more money, and will actually work. Make sure you buy that from the microchip website too because that one also has chinese clones floating around."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"This product seemed to work perfectly well. However, I put this on my keychain, which went into my pocket. The problem is that the little white cap falls off all the time. It is too loosely fitted to the drive, making it fall off with little to no force. It was only a matter of time before the cap fell off without my noticing. Now, I have no cap, and the device is pretty worthless to me without its cap."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"I bought this computer back in September with the 30 guarantee and when the computer was delivered without the keyboard and mouse, JD NETWORK SOLUTION LLC was quick to resolve the problem.  The computer has so far been great, runs great, runs Windows 7 great however, the copy of Windows 7 is NOT GENUINE.

Perhaps there is a reason JD NETWORK SOLUTION LLC isn't selling anything on Amazon anymore.  Now I'm on the hook for buying a new Windows license."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,I'll purchase again given the good deal and all the positive reviews but I had these for 2 weeks. The white ones mesh cap developed a hole in it and I just tried the pen side on the black one and as soon as I pulled the cap the threads holding the pen in stripped and the whole thing fell apart. Cheap price cheap product. It looks like for the most part their made well but quality is hit or miss
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"This sleeve fits just about any laptop - I had no trouble getting my Gateway with a 14"" screen to fit in it with room to spare.  I think I could also slide a pad of paper in too.  Neoprene should provide protection against light rain but I would not go so far as to say this is waterproof.  The external padding provides some protection against bumps and scratches but will not help much against really rough treatment."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"What a ridiculous product.

I wanted to be able to download large numbers of photographs directly to this WD drive, but that is not possible. You must first download to your main drive, THEN TRANSFER ALL YOUR FILES MANUALLY to the WD drive for mirroring and cloud access. Needless to say, no one has time for that.

And the worst thing is, I didn't connect this device within the 30-day window for returns. So it's useless, and cannot be returned.

Ugh and fail all around."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"This device has pretty good wifi coverage, but in reality it has muscles with no brain.

it takes 1 minute 45 sec. TO BOOT UP???, as if there is tons of servers on its back.

some times it shutdown on its on, and you come back to it finding it blinking red. although it works back after you restart it.

absolutely does not worth the money at all, I have invested 140$ and I don't wish to buy it or advice anyone to buy it."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"Good little flash drive; super small and the curve helps with inserting/removing from a computer laying flat. The only issue is that the keyring hole is so small, it will not fit on a standard sized keyring. You have to use the very small and cheaply built ring that comes with it. I plan on drilling out the hole to see if I can make it fit without damaging anything.

UPDATE: Drilled out the keyring hole (see picture) and the device still works!"
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"Ordered 3 (in yellow). Rec'd 2 but also 1 different ViewHD product that had a label slapped on it indicating it was what I had ordered... NOT! After explaining this very confusing situation to Amazon's now-barely-English-speaking cust. service, and because this is Amazon Marketplace and not Amazon, I have to keep the wrong thing (for which I have no use whatsoever), wait for a refund, and place a new order for the 3rd. I'm avoiding ""the Marketplace"" at all costs in the future."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"Little disappointed that this keyboard is pretty much completely solar dependent. Yes it has a small rechargeable watch-type battery, but I guess we don't have enough light in our office to keep it charged. Would have thought that the battery would be larger (like AA or AAA) or allow you to power via USB. Seriously, a watch battery as a backup power source?

The keys are good quality, not completely thrilled with the slightly rounded bezel though (prefer the edges on the mac keyboards)."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"Only six months in and the threading for the ball joint fell all to pieces.

I've only stored this indoors and I use it to clamp to my boats windshield for a good angle. This last time out I noticed I couldn't get the ball joint back in the socket, when I looked at it, three pieces had fallen off inside.

Wouldn't have been so bad if there was a way to connect it without the ball joint, but that doesn't seem to be the case."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"Received it on the agreed timing, shipping was okay, the product box was a little bit damaged. The product itself was good, no scratches or any defects. Returned it because it was simply too bulky or big for my ear, it would detach out of my face too much. The calls were okay, and worked as intended but the voice of the other callers sounded a bit noisy. Music playback is okay. Hope  this helps, if you like my review please let me know."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"Worked well for the 3 weeks I've had this amp. The optional SDB sound effect was surprisingly good. Had this connected to pioneer sb22. The music player on this device was ok, very basic with not much features, was a bit difficult to navigate around the settings. On the third week this amp started to act up, would not stay off, keeps turning itself on. Only way to turn off was to unplug it. Was still within return period and got a full refund."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"I've used this about 10 times and there are bump galore on all my shots. shooting anything outdoor is dreadful and a lot of post editing is needed. when the cam is on a tripod, I actually lift it by its neck as much as possible (but not suspending the entire unit in the air) so the bumps and shakes are less pronounced. I think the wheels are too small for outdoor use. The ground must be ultra smooth to have it work properly"
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"These were highly recommended and I think they sound quite good, at least for my purposes. I've used them 3 times but unfortunately, the earhooks have fallen apart every time. This is really a problem, since I got these to use while jogging. It doesn't help that the earhooks are still a bit too big for my ears. Ok, so my ears are small - but not freakishly so! So my search for suitable earbuds continues. They work for some people, but not me."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"Bluetooth connection is spotty and cuts out intermittently, especially when walking or even stopped at an interception waiting for the crosswalk, it can completely cut out for up to twenty seconds. Phone is in my pocket the whole time, not more than 2ft away from the device. Not sure if it's other devices interfering with it, or if the Bluetooth is constantly wasting itself trying to connect to nearby devices even when it's already connected to yours, but whatever the case,the Bluetooth connection is horrible."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,They seemed to be of decent quality until I opened the head piece a little too far and the plastic split. I've had them for 1.5 years but I planned on using them a lot longer. I only use them at the office so I expected them to last longer than my apple buds that I've had for 3 years. I wish people would make products that last a reasonable amount of time. It makes me apprehensive to order products from companies I don't know.
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"Pro's - Comfortable fit, short cord works well with MP3 Player on arm-band, extension cord works well, 3 different sizes of ear loops and ear cap covers.

Con's - Weak audio quality. In comparison, their quality is lower than Sony's $9.99 ear buds. Too costly for the quality you get.

My recommendation; If you're looking for work-out head phones get the Philips Magnavox Secure Fit Earbuds for $6.99.  If you want high quality in the ear headphones get the Maximo iM-490S iMetal Isolation Earphones for $45."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"Really a great projector but does not appear to be HDCP compatible. For home theater purposes, it didn't handshake with a receiver' s. Main HDMI output. It worked wonderfully with individual HDMI feeds plugged into it, has a great picture, bright clean, and the speakers even were loud enogh  for covering a small room well. Contacted Benq and Pioneer about the issues. Both said it was a fluke and Benq suggested an MH 630, which I have swapped to try. Hopefully will handle this."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"I gave it 2 stars because it does make a connection. The 3 I took off were because of the quality. If you require a MILSPEC USB cable then add them back in for your review. I do not. The cable was extremely rigid and the connector ends are huge. I have a Spigen case on my phone with a large opening for the charge port. It didn't even come close to fitting.

Good - transmits data and electricity
Bad - Extremely rigid and huge connector ends."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"Chiclet keys are long gone, yet this has one.  They work okay, the bad review is it leaves the guts of the machine open to damage...the keyboard is covered well, just don't drop it as the back side of the iPad is on its own.  Its also overpriced, but expect that to go down soon as the word gets around.  Not for protection, but if you keep the behemoth 12 inch iPad in the cottage, you'll be fine.  Unless you drop it."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"This system is fine if you are close to it, like the computer or video games, but for entertainment center use, it's just not as great as I was hoping. Sure, certain DVD's are louder, but some I've tried just are not as loud as I'd want with this system. I'd be better off hooking it up to my old component stereo system to get the loudness I want. I admit, the subwoofer puts out good bass, but the main speakers just don't have enough loudness."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"Bought for my 5 year old son, with the thought that he could put this on his iPod, and then side the ipod into a different case (flip-close case) for extra protection (his ipod was too loose in the flip-close case, and fell out, screen cracked, and we just had it fixed).  So this is good, but a bit difficult to take off once it's on (I was afraid I might crack it).  But seems to provide pretty good protection against minor drops and such."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"Great idea, but in practice it's so light that its hard to keep still on your lap and properly press keys, and the left/right mouse click buttons.  And the proprietary USB dongle is very easy to lose if you're moving from one machine to another...

On the positive, it just worked with every pc, mac and chromebox, linux box I tested it on.

I wouldn't recommend to a friend.  I replaced this with a Logitech K810 (bluetooth with 3 dedicated device configured buttons to easily switch to 3)."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"Computer speakers always seem very expensive for as crappy as they are.  You can get great speakers for your car for easily under $100.

While they are adequate, high quality sound should not be expected.  They do work though and are reasonably stylish.  They could have used a little longer cable.  I had to put left on right and right on left to reach my tower which sits to the left of my desk.  The speakers are mounted a little high on the hutch though."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"I'm looking for a cheap usable tripod.  Polaroid a legit brand name, so that I gave it a try.  However, this tripod is very difficult to use.  Both turning from left to right and turning from up to down felt very sluggish. The dual bubble level was useless since I couldn't keep the position I wanted.  I ordered a brand new one, but the one I got looked like a used one, maybe that's the reason.  Anyway, I just review the product I received."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"I really liked this bag the first two times I used it. Plenty of room, comfortable, and seemed pretty secure. However the second time I took it through the airport, one of the front hooks came off. Couldnt find it. Turns out that they're not sewn on. Theyre just hooked on with two small hooks.

Im sitting at the airport halfway through my fourth trip and it seems that Ive lost the other one. Too bad. If the hooks were sewn on this would be a very happy five star review."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"I was going to write a great review about this product a while ago, but kept delaying it.  And it's a good thing I delayed it.  This hard drive lasted about 3.5 years.  I bought it in May 2010 and it broke in December of 2013.  I never used it heavily.  Only used it as backup.  Finally, it went bad.  I still have a couple of hard drives by this brand that I purchased between 6 and 10 years ago and they're still operating."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"It's just Meh... I was expecting a bit different, as the video on YouTube reviewing this showed a much different model than what I recieved.  It works, but is hard to focus and I still haven't gotten it to really focus correctly.  It DOES work with my iPhone 6S though, and fits my head and is not uncomfortable to wear.

Production quality seems about what I'd expect at this price.  Not stellar, but not abysmal either. I'd probably buy one as a gift if I knew someone who'd enjoy it."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"I guess if you use headphones with mikes on your cell, land line and computer this would come in handy. Personally I rarely use headsets with my phones and my mike is connected via my webcam.  The footprint is not as big as it appears in the picture. Just don't really have a use for this.  At it's price point it's a bit of a luxury item It does work as advertised. Sound quality remained as good as the headphone I tested it with was  on a direct connection.."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"I have 2 new Megabooms, and saw that they had a new offer to sell refurbished ones, so I bought 2 more. One is fine, the other is blown, right out of the box. So obvious, I can't believe anyone would say it was even close to ""refurbished"". I am sending that one back, and ordering another refurb, so I will post an update when received. They are a great value for the quality. My rating is really for the obviously failed product being shipped without apparently checking to see it if worked."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"I ordered this to use with my tascam DR-05 audio recorder.  It appears to be a non functioning piece so this was not a good buying experience however due to the low cost I won't bother with trying to return it. I cannot say this wasn't just a faulty unit or whether others have had problems.  I have tried other adapters and experienced the same.problem.  If you need reliability you might just connect your device via the usb connection cable provided by the manufacturer, which is not always a sure thing."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"I returned Nikon Coolpix S8200 camera mainly because when in play mode it would lock-up when scrolling through (still) pictures that I had taken. The only way I could correct was to remove and re-install the battery. It also overheated during video recording and stopped recording. The manual warns of this but I did not expect it to occur so quickly. I returned the camera and received a full refund from Amazon. I then purchased (from Amazon) a Lumix ZS20, now I get wonderful pictures, wonderful zoom, wonderful HD video (including zooming while recording)."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"I bought this specific speaker because of the FM mode that way I can save some battery while listening at work.
Many other reviewers mentioned the radio on the same exact model I have and it's not available on mine. I believe it was removed.
Also the nasal voice informing you that the speaker is on, what mode it's on and that bluetooth is paired is  bit annoying.
Turning the volume all the way up will make a loud beeping sound letting you know you on max volume.
The sound is really good though. Very loud and crisp."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"Hated it.  I should have checked the size--it's smaller than you'd think.  Too small; even if you're used to an Apple Magic Mouse, as I am, this is uncomfortably short and flat.  Instant carpal tunnel.  The movement is awkward, the gestures across the top don't work very well (though admittedly that could come with practice.

Be warned that unlike most Amazon items, you'll have to pay return shipping if you don't like this.  My advice, if you're considering it, is find a store that carries them and try it out first."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"I bought this so I could transfer photos from my SD card to a USB stick for on-the-road photo backup.

This product is designed to complete the task, however it is unable to fulfill its purpose.

The App will been to transfer photos, but then stops and quits about 30 seconds in.

So you can transfer 1 file at a time, but if you have more than 1 digital photo to transfer, it won't work.

I'm going to put my unit in the trash as I don't need more electronic junk in my life.

Next time I will just bring the laptop!"
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"It has a very solid structure, far different than many others netbooks that have a plastic body. Design is nice, it's a pretty and sexy machine. I wouldn't say fantastic because of its strange rear ""increment"". Anyway, better than the Acer Aspire. Keyboard is OK.

But, when it comes to performance... well, everytime you restart it or open Internet Explorer or Microsoft Office 2007, you'll remember that your old desktop machine performs better than this new little one and that you should have spent a few more bucks for a Dual-Core or a Core2Duo machine with more RAM."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"i bought these, they were fairly cheap (10 bucks if i remember correctly).. the sound was decent, a bit too bassy and unless you had the wire under a shirt, you'd hear it every step you took.

within 6 weeks the first one's broke, i emailed skullcandy and they gave me a new set, just had to mail them the plug.

within 2 weeks the second set broke.. i never tried for another pair..

so if your delicate, don't mind the chord under your shirt, and don't mind losing out on headfones every other month or so then buy them."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,Very nice for the money but this cannot hold tight when tilting.  It's like you can't tighten it enough with that knob.  I had I manfrotto that is pretty much its competitor and paid 3 times as much.  If you have a light set up its probably okay.  For my set up it does work and the price was great but my manfrotto works 100% with no worries so you still pay for what you get.  Benro is value manfrotto is quality.  You have to pick which is more important for you
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"Nice unit, although shipped with old firmware that supposedly has problems under 10.3.9. Since the drive has no direct contact with the case, and there is no fan, I would be reluctant to use it for a hot running drive. The attachment did not seem very well designed, and I could see the drive breaking loose. But these same weaknesses are also a strength; firmware can be upgraded, no fan means silent, and the rubber hard drive attachments insulate against noise. I was pleased with the value.

Failed on me, looked like corrupted firmware that could not be updated."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"I got a Amazon Fire TV Bundle; for cord cutters. It came w/ a Amazon Basics digital antenna ($9.99). As I am a cord cutter, I wanted a ""Better Antenna"" for another tv not using Fire. This antennas' power plug burnt out on day 5, I replaced it & two days later the amplifier went out along w/ the power indicator bulb. W/O the amplifier it picks up 10 ota channels. While the Basic One gets 33 with & 29 W/o. Save the money a buy the Amazon Basics Digital Indoor Antenna & U will be better for it."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"Please, stay away from this product. Yes it has good reviews but those are reviews of people who barely got the tablet. I thought I made an awesome buy but I was wrong. After a couple of weeks it won't turn on regardless of what you do. Unfortunately I lost my receipt and it was a headache trying to get walmart to help me. I recommend buying the ASUS T100 just add a little bit more money and you will be getting a reliable product than this tablet. PLEASE DON'T BUY IT!!! SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY A DIFFERENT TABLET."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"I love The Apple Ipad (we'll see about this one), but this is NOT Apple Refurbished. This is just USED! I've purchased a lot of Refurbished items over the years, and most are as good and sometimes better, than new. This iPad had the old protective plastic reapplied (poorly), had food crumbs in the box. The charge cable was just stuffed in. The packaging was not complete and was rather beat up.

Wife just called and said it would not charge over night. The charging cable is bad.

Glad that Amazon takes good care of their customers on this type of purchase."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"I like many things about it. It has a gold coated metal, which means it won't rust and connectivity stays good for very long time. Also it seems to be very well made overall. But there one that bothers me a lot. It's cable. Since cable is very thick and hard, it is not flexible enough. Once connected to your phone, you have this cable that curves BIG around your phone, instead it should drips down nicely. (I hope this makes sense to you) If this doesn't bother you at all, I do recommend this product. Hope this reviews helps you."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"I own a longer length of this.  when I cut it open and examined it, I found a nice foil wrap (good) but shockingly very little copper braid, which IS the return path to current flow and also provides a place to ground TO.  all the foil in the world won't help when the copper is so thin and weak.  same for inner conductor, the wire quality is poor and the strands are few.  the dialectric is not flexible and is too stiff.

this is low quality cable.  if you buy a sample and cut it, you'll see."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"Installed no problem. REMEMBER it is 3.5 NOT 5.2, so it won't fit in a standard drive bay. (like a cd drive bay)

Gave it two stars because my CF card slot is broken. Cant even put a CF card in it. Fortunately I cant see myself NEEDING it, but that still makes this defective.

Not gonna return it because I don't really need the CF slot.

Also the sd card slot is upside down.... which is odd. At first you might think that IT TOO is broken, then you try it upside down and all is well.

USB port seems to work just fine as well."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"I love this little chromebook for what it is ($99 nowadays). With that said...it just doesn't have the power for any fun droid games, but works perfectly for typing and internet browsing. ALSO, its not quite Windows compatible (between gdocs and Word) AND you cannot hook up a printer. There is NO installing programs as it is a Chromebook. Great for what it is, but having originally spent $400, I would like to have gotten more versatility out of it. If you want something for the kids or just will be using to write with in gdocs, at $99, this is a good deal."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"I made the mistake of thinking, or maybe not thinking, that between Amazon and 47th Street that this would be an acceptable substitute to the more expensive lenses out there. Boy was I wrong! The lens not only vignettes but the color is washed out and the focus is soft to fuzzy. All in all you get what you pay for and in this case I didn't even get what I paid for.

STAY AWAY FROM THESE LENSES, THEY ARE JUNK!!!!!!!

P.S. I have not heard back from 47th St. about a return for credit after 4 days either. I will update that part of the situation."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"I, recently, bought this unit, for a friend.  Upon installation, I found it to have a crystal clear picture, but here is the drawback.

In order to hear ANY sound at all, the box had to be placed on MAXIMUM volume, AND I had to set my stereo on ""acid rock concert"" volume level, to hear ANY sound, at all.  In short, to hear any volume, at all, I had to set the volume so loud that, for any other device, I would have had noise complaints, from my neighbors.

AVOID this product, if you are serious about enjoying t.v..

Its just NOT worth the headache."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,This product is all plastic with a fake leather like material pretty much glued on to the casing. My wife's ipad mini 2 retina would not fit this case. One side corner would snap in and the other wouldn't even push in. Past reviews say they fixed issues with the hinge. I do not agree. This product wasn't even worth the $30 I spent including shipping and the overall price is $99... It's plastic. Cheap plastic. Only reason I give a 3 star rating is because the seller responded quickly and because their shipping was so quick. My seller review would be considered a 5 star.
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"Got the item, and was excited since I needed to verify all the cables in my house.  Started using it, and it worked for checking 3-4 cable runs, green lights would line up (make sure you check the receiver unit, as it needs to blink the green lights in the correct order).  Then after that the power light on the main unit just stayed solid, couldn't get it to work after that.  Tried changing batteries, etc, nothing.

For the price it's a great deal, but if you need to rely on it, you might want to look elsewhere or buy two just in case."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"Just to be clear, this is in no way a Steadicam and the serious DIY'er could almost certainly cobble up something just as capable himself by putting a handle on a ball-socket tripod head & using a suitable counterweight. Still, for the price, one couldn't expect too much. The biggest downside to this is that it requires more hands than the average human comes equipped with in order to use effectively, coupled with a very light touch & many many hours of practice [complicated by the desire it inspires to just throw it against the nearest hard immovable object during that long learning curve to achieve competence."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"First off I ordered the black set, was sent lime green. I use them at work in a shop so whatever color doesn't matter. But now that i have had them for a couple months they are absolutely awful with battery life. They die literally after 30 minutes of podcast listening. Put them on a charge and supposedly after 10 minutes the light goes blue and they're charged? False. Worse than a cell phone battery life. The 30.00$ plus shipping that i paid is NOT worth it. Spend the extra money on yourself and get a better product. I will be having to do the same soon."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"UPDATED REVIEW (2 YEARS LATER):
Only recommend this product if you're going to lay it flat on the floor. If you're trying to stick to a wall, forget about it. It WILL not stay.

Very solid and well-made product. Took some getting used to stuffing speaker cable inside. I used the entire length and didn't need to cut into. Worked out very nicely after all was said and done. The double-side tape took a minute to get the backing off, but once I did, it was SUPER STRONG. Hopefully, it stays stuck to my tile flooring and I never have to worry about unsightly cables again. Much thicker than I had anticipated."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"So, the original charger lasted about 3 years without a problem, then suddenly had a short at the plug end.  I bought this one to replace it.  The male plug side is too short - and will not properly seat in the XOOM to charge it properly.  When I tried to push it up, it shorted out against the housing.

I bought a NEW MOTOROLA charger, and have used it twice now, no issues with the plug and no shorting out.  So I recommend you save yourself my pain, and buy the Motorola OEM Charger (also on Amazon) for $9 vs. the $6.75 that this thing cost."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"Does what it is supposed to for about 6 months then the 2nd output starts to loose sync (may be a heat issue).  Will be watching a movie on the 2nd output and the TV will loose signal, then about 10 seconds latter the signal will return.  This only happens on the 2nd output as others have had the same problem.

Also sometimes the switching wouldn't switch on the first try, would change to a different input and back then it will work (did this from the time it was new).  I just programmed my remote to automatically switch back and forth when I turned on my TV."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"Nice, small size and professional appearance (for a backpack) if that is what you are looking for.  I have to agree with other posters though, the zippers are poor quality.  They stick and I have to straighten out the teeth to get them to work again.  Don't pull hard, just back up, straighten the teeth and try again.  Kind of a pain and I am concerned about longevity.

Update 8/16/16 - Just continued problems with the cheap zippers.  The backpack has held up well and the materials seem to be of very high quality.  But these zippers stink.  They don't work most of the time."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"Great product at first, but degrades over time.  This product is super easy to install.  It's literally plug and play.  The speeds it provides is meh.  I have a 75MBPS connection but only about 30MBPS gets through on this adapter.  Other powerline adapters keep me on much higher speeds.  After a few months, the adapter would lose connection for about a minute every so often.  As more time went by, it'd get worst and worst eventually leading me to abandon it all together.  It wasn't THAT bad, but two or three times a day was more than enough for me to give it up."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"These speakers were a great value replacement for the stock system. There is nothing special about these other than the frequency range is good and they don't distort. They are not very loud, although I am running them with a 4x50W Pioneer and Pyle Components up front that blast these away. Once I get an added amp for the components, I will see how they do with 200W, they will probably be able to handle more volume and distortion with more power available. I am satisfied so far and have not been disappointed yet. If you are interested, I'd recommend these for anyone looking for a good decent clean sound without any problems."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"The first few days it was awesome, clear sound for me and I loved it...
4 days in however, it started having a tinny sound or, more like a buzzing/crackling that was very faint. It sounds a little like a radio station that is out of tune. I had a few issues where people could hear me but I couldn't hear them at all, like it wasn't pushing audio to the headset.

It is working fine now but still has a thin, not so perfect reception. If I hadn't tossed the package I would have returned them. I'd recommend going with the LG Tones or the Motorola ones, everyone I know says they love those."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"I will return it.

For three reasons:
1) It requires the root SSID to be broadcasted.
2) In repeater mode, it shows up as a dup SSID. Basically if the root AP's SSID is ""Foo"", with this repeater, I see two ""Foo"" on my Macbook Air.
3) Its plug is right in the middle and its body's bulky. That cause a problem: when I plug it in to a panel with two outlets, the other outlet is barely accessable.

I also bought the other repeater TP-LINK TL-WR700N. The TP-link is better. It supports hidden root SSID and it doesn't add a dup. Its plug is on the side so it works well with the plug in the other outlet."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"Overall does what a hub should do. Works 100% with powered devices like printers and scanners. But it doesn't like iPods: the connection will be lost (not a good idea to disconnect an iPod without ""ejecting"" it), or no connection will be made at all, or the port on the computer where the hub is connected will lock up.

Also, the build quality is poor. The silver finish is uneven, even worn off (out of the box) in a few spots. And the clear cover over the LED indicators is falling off.

Perhaps Belkin's new ""Plus"" hubs are better, but I'm not willing to find out.

Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"I'm running this 4 port USB hub PCMCIA card on an old Dell Inspirion 8600 laptop that is driven by Windows XP.  When installed, XP failed to recognize the hub and showed an error on the hardware install. However, the hub works anyway and every device that I've connected to the hub installs and/or is recognized right away.  I notice an annoying squeaky electronic sound whenever I connect a device to the hub but it does not seem to effect system or software operation so I live with it.  In hind sight I'd recommend getting a simple 2 port hub card for a laptop, this one is really overkill for my purposes."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"I bought this to use in transferring data among my various netbooks, laptops and desktop computers I have at home and in my workshop. Seemed to perform just fine when connected directly to onboard USB ports, but very, very sensitive to being connected via powered USB hubs. With one system (WinXP home with a powered USB hub) it totally took down the USB bus as long as it was plugged in - not good at all.

So - seems OK as long as you're not using a USB hub. But unfortunately it's a pain for me to disconnect something else in order for me to plug directly into an onboard USB port on the one system."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,I got this for my trail camera SD cards.  I found it hard to keep open and remove the SD cards.  I already have 4 ripped slots that will not keep the card in now.  With all the good reviews I thought it would be better.  The book is a nice size and I love having my cards organized but at the rate I am going I might not have any good slots left.  I found the best way to get the cards out is to push them from the bottom like a tube of toothpaste.  This works great on the inner slots but not on the outside ones.
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"This network drive is a piece of junk. I have had it for just a few months. Now it will only stay running for just a few minutes. This is my second Buffalo drive. The first drive I had one of two drives fail after only a few months. I wish the first one had failed a little sooner because I would have never bought the second one. I'm was using them for backups. Not a very good track record. I'm going back to using external USB drives. I have not contacted tech support because I have had to spend so much of my time moving all the backup files to the USB drives.

Avoid Buffalo network drives."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"I bought it for use at work, so I use it everyday. It took some time to get used to the placement of they keys that normally would have been around the number pad area. I've had this for about a year and I still mess up sometimes and accidentally hitting the insert button instead of delete. Cons? The button placement. Lifespan of the batteries in the number pad (it's been dead for a while, but the keyboard is still operating on the same batteries that came with it). Doesn't fit in a keyboard tray correctly.

Knowing what I know now, I probably wouldn't have bought it, but it works good enough for me to keep using it."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"The Intellitune sucks. Often time it will tune to a station with a strong occupied reception. When you manually set the station, it will drop off constantly. The auxillary 3.5mm jack is loose fitting, so much as to interrupt playback while driving. Just had a bad experience with this. Their tech support weren't of help also. Told me to just return it to whom I bought it from  and get my money back. They couldn't even cross reference the name of the product to the model number. No model number on packaging or their website, just on item itself, which you'd need a magnifier to read. Only thing going for this item is its looks, nothing else."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"I love Garmin products but continue to be less enthusiastic of their bike mount systems. This one slips regularly for me, but I do want to share that my Cannondale's handle bars are tapered, and it's challenging to keep any mount in place. It's still far better than mounting your Garmin Edge product on the handle bar stem. The Front Mounts provide much safer visibility during rides, where you need to keep your eyes on the road. For on our rough wine=country roads between Napa, Sonoma and Marin County roads, this mount slips dropping my Edge 1000 point straight down at my front tire. I've been using a third party solution that is much more reliable for me."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"It's really nice if you use apple music exclusively. I have a 2014 BMW and an iPhone, and I just don't feel like the software is cracked up for this. When you get in the car, it auto plays your music, but ONLY apple music. So I'll have Pandora going, get to the grocery store, come back to my car, and Apple music starts playing. Then I hit pandora back on, and Apple music will start playing. Its like an auto feature that just won't quit. After the 1st or 2nd time it takes though. It's kinda annoying, but it does connect very well wirelessly. If apple would let you set a default music app, I think this would be better!"
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"Per other reviews the cloth versions for the G930 don't work properly and the only ones that work correctly is the black one.  Yet, the pillow for the black versions doesn't work for the G930!  Catch-22 for those who have disintegrating pillows and ear pads.

The title is difficult to understand, as it contains so much information.  Titles and information needs to be clear and not ambiguous and this item title could be much clearer.

While the ear pads look to be functional, what I got won't work 100% on the G930.  I really thought it would work.  Can't the seller be clear on what works?  Can't the seller provide a G930 BLACK ear pad and pillow?"
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"Well, I've had this tripod for 4 months now. I hoped (like many others) that it was a solid aluminum beast, but the truth is, it isn't. It's mostly hard black plastic. The plastic is OK, but it broke on me on the plastic where the legs connect to the central member.

I purchased a Dolica Proline at the same time as this one. So far it has been a better, more durable tripod (overall).

This one out-performs the Dolica if it's being used for shooting videos though.

The Sony name is good, but this product is relatively brittle. I would recommend it only for someone who will use it for light-duty purposes.

I give it 3.25 stars (despite the fact that it broke on me."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"It's very sleek and fits nicely on my keychain, so I won't have to worry about having a flash drive when I need it.  For large files, though, it's much slower than any other flash drive I have.  I bought the 16GB version so I could move large files back and forth between computers, but it's a bad choice for that role.  A 500MB file took almost 3 minutes to save on this drive (avg 3.5 MB/second), compared to a bit more than a minute on an old Sandisk Cruzer drive. If you're moving small .mp3s on and off, you'll love it.  If you want to move big files, you'll need lots of patience -- or another drive."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"Sorry can't give a good review when the product you get is different than what is shown in the photos. Tri legs are a standard in photography because they add stability compared smaller 4 leg base. Why would Fotodiox change this to a 4 leg design is beyond me. Also why have they not updated the photos, could it be because they know most photographers will look at other products if they do. It's nice that the legs fold but poor design that putting the spigot on the the top leg takes away the ability to fold the legs for storage and transport. It seems the early positive reviews are from before Fotodiox changed the product without updating the description or photos."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"Bought this tv on black Friday 2010 from Best Buy! It is now February 2012 and the tv is dead! 1year 2 months and that's all $1000 worth of Panasonic tv got me. Simply put, the picture quality is really nice while the stupid thing works, but plan on only having it work for less than 2 years. Panasonic customer service will not assist in any way to remedy the situation and they won't even give me the contact info for an authorized repair place. Needless to say that this will be my first and last Panasonic product ever. I will never purchase another Panasonic product no matter what cnet or anyone else says about them and no matter how ""highly"" they're rated."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"I was a little apprehensive about this one, due to the the comments here. I took the plunge after confirming that it would work with my HP 6540 printer. Setup was easy - but since I run WPA on the wireless side, hooking up to the wired side was a necessity for configuring it (of course - how would it know your key?)

The quick start guide was passable, I ended up using the PDF version of the full manual instead.

It does run very hot - but since everyone says this about them, I'm sure it's ""normal"". I'm currently trying to decide whether I will leave it on all the time, or keep the printer and printserver powered off until I need to print."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"Great price and set up was easy. Just remember to go on line and complete the registration as well as the final setup steps. The reception on the Range extender installed in our basement registered  2 sets of bars for strength. My WD MyNet 600 router is located in my office 2 floors above,
The signal strength to my Roku device for the basement TV jumped from Poor-Fair to Excellent after the range extended was set up.
Update:
It's 3 months after initial install and I am having the same problems as other users. The extender drops the connection and needs a reboot.
There is no new FW to update which means there is no fix. Looks like WD just gave up.
My advice, find a different product."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"This unit didn't work right out of the box.  I intended to use it to transfer old VHS tapes to DVDs but was never successful.  It's really picky about which DVD blank it would accept.  When I finally found one that appeared to work, I followed the directions for copying and got all the indications that I was successful.  When I put the DVD in the computer there wasn't anything on there...went through this three times before I gave up and bought some transfer software for the computer.  I ended up using it as a VHS player and transferred the files to digital format on the computer.

Not ruling out error on my part, but I couldn't make it work."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"I returned this item because I really just didn't like it. to me, It felt like it was going to fall apart by the end of a semester of school. I hated that you couldn't use the surface pro's best kickstand to date. The little velcro pieces that held up the stand terrified me. I really just didn't want to use my device with this. I'm giving it three stars because for me, it was not at all what I would like. For others, this might be perfect. If your kickstand isn't the best, this might be your solution. If you need a cover that will look a little stylish at a low price, again, not bad. I really just didn't like it for me."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"admittedly, this camera is very inexpensive for the feature set you get. but we needed to change batteries far too often to make this a worthwhile investment. Also the lack of optical zoom means you are essentially buying a 35 mm point and shoot, so great if that's what you want (and u r willing to spend $10/week on batteries for regular ""vacation"" usage). IF you want greater flexibility, and something u won't grow out of or tired of real fast, u should keep looking for something that may involve extra initially, but you will get more use of.

In short, great price, but serious shortfalls w. respect to battery life and camera capabilities. Also, the cycle time between shots (especially when using flash) is painfully sloooooooow."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"The Battery keeps discharging - almost every time I need to use it, it's dead or near dead.  After a few months of use it will only charge to 90% and once you take if off the USB charger, it drains in about 1 week when not used at all, and when I did attach it and begin using it for a few minutes the charge shows 50%.  I have a DUD !

Had the battery BacPac worked as advertised it would have been useful.

The battery has it's own usb port for charging and a small meter on the back which you can check by pressing a small button on the side of the battery - I suspect the electronics inside the battery is defective."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"I had a chance to listen to these at a local audio shop. I wasn't too impressed at all. Really disappointing sound quality considering the price. The mids are what's really bad I think--they have a tin-can quality to them that's not pleasant or realistic. This is common in the Beats line, I think the Studios are slightly better but they have other issues. For the same price or less, you could get some really great headphones. Check out AKG's Q-701, or Sennheiser Amperiors, or Audio-Technica M50's, or Shure 840's. They're all much more realistic sounding with clearer mids, smooth highs, and tight realistic bass. You'll learn to love and appreciate the more realistic sound other headphones provide, and your wallet will appreciate it too."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"This drive failed on me at a critical moment in the field. I had only owned it for 6 months, and it was not used very intensively. It spent its short life in my laptop satchel and was never dropped or otherwise damaged.

During a photo shoot, I tried to copy data from my full laptop hard drive to the Passport. The drive simply would not work. It was powered on and spinning but the computer could not see it or use it. After trying to get it working, it began making clicking noises and I determined it to be dead.

I'd hate to think that being jostled in my bag was enough to cause this drive to fail. If that's the case, then it has serious durability issues."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"As an update to my original review back in 2013: I began having problems with this about 8 months after I purchased it. It crashed 3 times over a matter of two years. I'm uncertain if it was caused by the demand from FSX but I do know something was notably wrong. To be fair, I may just have received a faulty piece of hardware. Nonetheless, after the third nose-dive; out it came. I didn't care about warranties at that point and I am thankful that my OS was not on it. Sadly, it was the worst hard drive that I ever had. I replaced it with a 250 GB SSD which has been magnificent. My current opinion is that Solid State is the only way to go."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"Similar issue to another recent reviewer.  The screen I received did not have LP133WF2 anywhere on it, except for a printed sticker on the cardboard packing.  Instead, the labels on the screen itself said N133HSE-EA3.  The port on this particular screen is on the opposite side from the cable and the OEM screen.  The cable is too short to reach to the opposite side, and after removing the bottom cover, I discovered you can't even move the cable to the other side as the port on the motherboard is on the same side as the OEM screen.  Frustrating given the inaccurate product name, description, and images.  Further frustrating because it took 4 days to ship, although it is prime eligible and in stock!"
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"I strongly suggest you ""try"" to call acer/gateway tech service before you buy any of there junk. They want to charge 129. 00-200. 00 for help on the phone. Sure its got a warranty but after that I wish you the best. Also if you look at the manual you'll notice something missing. Thier phone number. Try to find it online if you can. They have a 1-800 number but all it is for is to give you the run around. Best of luck with this company. never again! They eat power cords every few months. They have recalls going on for burning and thats what this P. O. S. did and I could not get in touch with them so I called BBB. Theres bad service and there ""NO SERVICE"" its a big difference!  ACER/GATEWAY SUCKS!!!!!!

Electronics_5,negative,truthful,I bought this to use with my tablet and games I own because in some games it would be much easier to use a controller than pressing the screen like Metal Slug. Unfortunately the maker states more compatibility than it really has. I can get some games to kinda work and others don't work with it at all. It says there is tons of games on the market it is compatible with but only shows me 20 and I don't own any of them. I am currently trying it with other controller programs and some of them could work it better than Nyko's own program which is frankly sad. I want to be able to use and love this controller more and hope Nyko improves their program and compatibility more.
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"I wanted to like this.  It seemed like it would be perfect for travel - I wouldn't have to haul chargers,  just cords & this strip.  Well,  I just tried everything out.  The 3 power outlets all work,  but only 1 of the 3 usb ports works.  Guess I picked the wrong power strip.  I don't I know how hard it will be to return or exchange it, but due to 2 of 3 usb ports being dead,  its not much better than any cheap old power stripI have laying around. Glad I ordered far ahead of travel so I can find an alternative.

Will change / update 1 star  review if I get a replacement on which all features work."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"I purchased this product and there was no option in the tools menu to change the aspect ratio from 16:9 to 4:3.  When I called the company, I was told--too bad, you must have an early model and there is no way you can fix it.  When I inquired about the wisdom of designing a product that does not use an aspect ratio consistent with the image produced by cameras, I was told---it wasn't my decision.

Even if I could change the aspect ratio (which leaves part of the screen as wasted), you cannot turn on and start the slide show while the device is in the frame.  Consequently, I don't think it would get used very much.

Between the bad product and bad attitude, this company deserves to go broke."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"I wanted to use it with my TV. Basically use a Bluetooth headphone with a TV. Once you connect to a bluetooth device you can hear this background humming sound. I'm very sure that its from this device and not the bluetooth headphones. I use the headphones very regularly. The humming sounds I suppose can be ignored because once the sound starts playing you don't hear it. But then there is a delay in the sound. I think it's about half a second (or maybe 300ms) which is pretty bad. Bad enough that you can't really watch TV like that. Considering the quality of sound, the delay and the background humming, its not worth the price.

I haven't tried other products so I don't know if this is a standard problem with all Bluetooth Tx."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"This was purchase for my girlfriends new 2011 13.3 macbook air. When it was designed I doubt there was any test fitting or any testers before mass producing this. For there are some issues with the bottom piece. When it is fully clipped on the top part hits the screen lid when you lift open then screen which can damage and make marks on the lid. My second issues is the little kick feet. I found them very useful but one is very loose and when carrying or moving the macbook air it makes a annoying clicking noise. On the good note this is a good strong case, light weight, and keeps the thinness of the macbook air looking thin. Until they fix this issues I don't recommend this product due to the annoying flaws."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"I guess they're...okay? For the price, maybe they're not so bad. What drives me crazy is that there is no ""disconnect"" button. When you turn on, it automatically connects to the last paired device. So if I want to connect to my kid's device, but my phone is turned on and it was connected to my phone previously, I can't make it disconnect. I have to go to my phone and turn off Bluetooth before it will allow connection anywhere else.

I'd love to be wrong about this and will change my review if so, but it seems it just can't be made to disconnect.

As for audio, they sound like low end headphones. Better than earbuds, but nothing of note. The ear area is a touch small so if you're an adult, they might feel squishy."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"It does as advertised, mostly. It's on the buggy side as sometimes my mouse gets ""lost"" and neither machine works with input and I have to unplug the cable and plug it back in. As my laptop is right on the desk it's no problem but if you have this tucked away it could be an issue.

Turning the other computer into an extended monitor is really neat and very helpful when I need a third screen for work. Normally either a KVM or switching inputs would solve this except my gsync monitor only has one input and a KVM limits the frame rate and breaks gsync so that's not a solution for me where this is.

I've used a few different KM switches and they are all problematic, this is the most seamless solution I've found yet."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"I love that radio. It is a good brand too.

But it has some issues.

First it seemed to use a lot of juice. I seemed to be putting batteries in it every so often. That was not that much of a pain.

But I discovered that once a station was program into the radio there was no way to blank it out. All you can do is program another station in that pre-set. In other words there was no way to clear all or any of the pre-sets. I tried and tried all to no avail.

I am just not that thrilled with radio. I have seen gone back to the simply little Sony radio that costs about $30 or so. That bad boy is rugged, easy to use and lasts forever on one battery. The Sangean takes two."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"Within 17 months of purchase, my Toshiba Regza (a $1,500 television set) is unusable.  About 1/3 of the screen is covered with multicolored vertical lines.  The authorized repair center wants $2,000 in total to fix the TV set (it requires an $1,800 part). Toshiba customer service tells me I am out of luck because the product is out of warranty.  They were not particularly nice, helpful, understanding, or at all interested in learning more about what is an obvious design defect in an allegedly high-end product.  It is  within Toshiba's discretion to service out of warranty products which have such profound failures within such a short period of time.  I will never buy another Toshiba product and will share my negative experience with as broad an audience as is possible."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"I bought two of these in September of 2012 - purchases were separated by 12 days. Well, one in my fathers Samsung Galaxy S2 died 10-15 days ago, and the one in my Samsung Galaxy S3 just died today, 2/20/2013. It seems they have a short life span - just 5 months, or I was just lucky enough to get 2 bad ones.

These were inserted into the phone and never handled poorly, never removed out of the phone, never exposed to anything - they just died.

I am giving it three stars because they worked just fine while they worked. I have a ticket opened with Sandisk as I am past the 90 day window with Amazon. I'll see how they respond, and if they will send me a replacement, and then I might update this review."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"Nothing special here. Good inexpensive headphones that are comfortable on your
ears and head.

These phones fit on top of your ears using foam covers. The fit is not too tight
and yet do not fall off the head easily. Of course I am not exercising with
these phones so maybe someone else can comment on their ability to stay on
the head during a workout.

A nice convenience is that the ear phone cups rotate flat if you would like to
compact them or hang them around your neck when not in use.

For the money, less than $12.00, they are adequate and if you walk on them or
the dog eats them not much of a loss.

Not a bad replacement for ear-buds if you prefer a descent set of portable
headphones. On notice: a lot of ear-buds will actually reduce exterior noise better
than these cups."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"Are people really dum enough to pay this for this cable that costs less than 10 bucks to make? Evidently some people think if they pay more money they will get better quality. NOT true.

HDMI 1.4 cables can be had for a decent price (I often catch a special and get them less than 2 for 10 bucks).

This is an outrageous insulting offer and the so called hype about this cable is completely wrong.

As has been already belabored here, a cable is either going to work or it isn't for HDMI. There's nothing ""Ultimate"" about this cable.

PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. If you have that kind of money to burn I'll be happy to take your money, give you TEN good HDMI 1.4 cables and pocket the rest! DON'T BE A FOOL AND BELIEVE THE HYPE."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"I have Comcast 75Mb service.  I had a very old zoom 5341J (8x4) running until it died.  I put back in my even older Zoom 5341 (4x4) modem while I looked for a replacement.  I tried the Arris SB6141 (8x4) which worked well until it died.  So I decided to try something else and liked the idea of this 16x4 model.  However, once I replaced the Zoom, it would only achieve 55 Mb/s download.  I tried multiple power resets, but even though it bonded with 16 download channels I would peak about 55 Mb/s.  I put the very old Zoom (4x4) back in and it went back to 82Mb/s,  There are no configurable parameters.  I had expected at least the same performance and possibly better than the very old Zoom."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"It almost hurts to write a two star review for this speaker.  It's beautifully crafted and sounds great.

However, the auto-off function is a deal breaker, so this is going back.  I have battery powered Bluetooth speakers that don't have this ""feature""; why Polk decided to include it in an AC powered speaker makes no sense.  Further, when I power the speaker on, it doesn't automatically connect to the last known device.  I have to go back to my iMac every time and tell it to connect to the speaker.

Also, I haven't been able to keep the Airplay connection working for more than a few minutes.  I suppose this could be due to any number of factors, so I can't put this squarely on Polk, but that was one of the primary reasons I selected this particular model."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"I wanted a second ""reader"" for the iPad and this fits the bill. I tested the USB, SD and microSD slots with an iPad 2 iOS 5.0.x and they worked as expected for importing pictures. The ""5 in 1 Card Reader for iPad"" is big. It is larger than both the USB and SD card reader combined from the official Apple Connectivity Kit. I had a microSD-to-SD adapter already. This 5-in-1 is larger than all three of those pieces together. The 5-in-1 is definitely not made to Apple's quality standards. It also does not cost Apple prices. The one advantage of the 5-in-1 is that is is one piece so it is convenient when traveling. My conclusion is it is worth what I paid for it and is part of my travel bag. I continue to use my original Apple connectivity kit at home."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"I've had mine for years and today I have to replace it because of a blackout. Why? There is no way to set the time.

It has run fast for years. It gains 5 min. about every 8 months. So to compensate I set the alarm a little later every year so I can get up at the same time.

Had a blackout and now it is blinking 12:00. The internal battery died. I can't find the manual so I'm looking online to try to reset it. This clock has been the biggest pain in the derriere I have every owned.

I would rather to back to my wind up travel alarm and wind it every day than buy another one of these garbage alarms.

Avoid this auto set stuff. Find some good old-fashioned clock you can set yourself. If necessary, buy vintage and wind the thing every night."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"It appears that Arcos has skimped to make this a cheaper model. A MAJOR negative that the potential capacity is really a lot less than perceived. This is due to the inconceivable absence of ANY expansion via SDHC cards or any other flash cards. The greatly limits flexibility. It is always an important idea to leave a considerable amount of empty space on the locked up, internal flash of the unit, as performance several degrades, as the internal flash fills up. As it gets around 70%, besides the performance issues, sort issues, there is a much grater chance of database and OS, issues, because of the needing of large work areas, that are not available. Not allowing external expansion from SDHC, truly helps this situation. I guess this also forces Archos customers to HAVE to get propriatary Archos units and drives to expand at all. Skip this unit (however DON'T get a Ipod)."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"I recently bought this product, tried to install using installation CD, which locked up on the 9th step. Called tech support, was told the product, which was bought that day, was no longer under warranty as Lynksys bases warranty on production date, not date of purchase,(i'm not making this up!) so warranty expired while on Staples shelf. ""Manilla Mary"" told they would believe me this one time and give me a one time complimentary tech support session. Declined and went and exchanged for another of the same model, which had 9 months remaining on the one year warranty, spent 9 (yes, 9, i'm not joking) hours with ""Rangoon Randy"" ""Phillipine Phil"" etc over three nights only to find they are clueless on setting this up.  I still don't have a functioning router and don't know what the answer is but Lynksys most DEFINITLY isn't it."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,The camera is amazing in every way except for that it has a noticeable shake on the outside edge when shooting in 4k mounted on a tripod. This is a very well known issue with this camera and they claimed to have fixed it with a firmware patch but after applying the firmware the problem still remains. Even when you disable the steady shot feature it still happens so something else is causing the optics to vibrate inside of the camera. Sony has been little help so far with correcting the issue and even claimed the couldn't tell when I sent them a video clearly illustrating the problem. The truth is the issue isn't that bad and you have to 'notice it' and in all honestly the other features of the camera still make it my primary camera with anything I shoot for Barnacules Nerdgasm on YouTube.
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,Got this for Christmas last year. Had 2 6.5s and a bridged 12 hooked up. Ran 0 gauge from battery and ground and 12g to speakers. Worked well for about 6 months. Around July or August it started having issues channels failing in an odd way. Any amp Ive had in the past that has gone bad the channel stayed dead. It developed a whine in one speaker and then channels would randomly cut out until you turned it off for a few minutes and back on again. This would cut out in one channel one day and another on a different day. Rechecked wiring and all is good. Distortion is bad at higher volumes and bass is very muffled. For the price it sounded as expected and for the time it did work it worked ok. I did expect it to last longer than it did.
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"I mounted several projectors before, and this mount is one of the poorest design.

First, documentation was almost non-existent. You will need to ""fill in the gap"", to figure out where all the screws go.  Most of the time, I had to improvise and even use some nuts and bolts from my own tool kit.

Second, the mount did not fit Optoma HD131Xe.  I played around with different configuration options, and finally had to bend one of the arms, and put some holes in another, just to make it fit.

Third, the sliding arm design is very poor.  There is very limited range of adjustment (15 degrees according to the manual, but more like 10 degrees), and adjustment screws are very hard to reach.  Most of the good design mounts have full 360 horizontal turning ability, but not this one.  Once you installed it, you are done."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"I give this 2 stars as I am not just throwing it out.

What I wish someone told me before I wasted $9.95 on this:

It is small enough but for it's size the level of light is very poor. To give you something to compare it to, If I need more light I would prefer the flashing light app on my iPhone, that is brighter.

So what is this good for? If I need a little night lite I can turn this on and not worry about waking up my wife where my iPhone may be a little too bright.

I does serve a purpose, I am rating low because it does not serve the purpose for which I purchased it and wish someone else posted this over the 5 star reviews I read. Maybe they used to be brighter and better but in January 2015 this is little more than a child's toy."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"I normally use a Noizfree headset, which has stellar sound quality.

This one drops out the lower frequencies, and even the remaining ones just sound vastly off.. It's very hard to listen to music with this thing with all the distortion and missing frequencies.  Tried different levels of volume on both the unit and the phone.

Even plugging my noizfree set into the unit and bypassing the neckloop makes very little difference.  The neckloop is mono as expected, but the jack is stereo capable.

I suspect something is off with their bluetooth implementation.. it sounds like an AM radio.  Even given the limitations of Bluetooth audio, the unit itself feels and sounds cheap.

The volume control on the side is audibly noisy, when you change volumes you can hear it scratching.

As others have noted, pairing can be a pain... it did work with a Galaxy S3 and S4 after a few attempts."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"Bought The Satechi SD Mini & the X-Mini Happy from Amazon.

The X-Mini Happy was $28 more (at the time)
and also came with a 2GB SD Card (mini with adapter)
plus Earphones (Plug Type).

Both came with a Pull String Carry Sack.

I loaded 2 SD cards with the same MP3s,
synchronized the start as best as possible,
and compared the sound of each using the respective Mute Buttons.

No Doubt About It: the X-Mini Happy had a Better Sound.

The SD Mini sounded OK until it was being compared to the X-Mini Happy.

The X-Mini Happy seemed to have a Fuller Sound -
Particularly with the Classical Music
(Amazon's: 99 Most Essential Masterpieces of the Classical Era).

But if you don't want to spend the Extra Bucks for the X-Mini Happy,
you won't be Sad with the SD Mini.

Also, the Earphones included with the Happy are OK,
but when compared with the
""Monster Turbine High-Performance In-Ear Speakers"",
they were Sadly, Quite Inferior.
But this might have been an Unfair Comparison."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"Doesn't seem to work well with Mac devices. My USB 3.0 hard drive keep connecting and disconnecting repeatedly.

The charging ports seem to work fine but the layout of the ports on this are terrible. The right front and rear ports charge and provide connectivity and the front left ports charge only. This is problematic for my desk as the cut through for cable is on the left side.... where the charge only ports are located. Thus, I have to drag cables across my desk to plug them in making my desk look messy. The whole point of this was to allow me to ""hide"" my laptop under the unit, place a monitor on top and then route all of the cables in a clean manner.

I will tinker with it a little more but if I cannot get it to stop this connecting/disconnecting to stop I might have to return the unit and look for another alternative."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"It's okay, barely. You get what you pay for every time. It's good for a starter 5.1 setup but don't expect any oooos and aahhs.
I purchased the exact item from Walmart for $59.99.
The sound is okay if you use an equalizer to balance things out. Small speakers *always* mean small sound.
The four corner speakers are 8 Watts each. Don't let the ""150W"" fool you. The center speaker's qualitty reminds me of a pocket radio's speaker. It's very mid-range only and there's almost no tonal quality to voices.
The cables should be longer. I'm going to have to make extensions for my application. That's not hard since the speakers, except for the front right, are RCA. I believe a 9-pin D-SUB extension cable will work for the front right speaker but I'm not sure yet.
I would much rather have the volume control separate instead of on one of the speakers as my right speaker is four feet away."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"Let's see...
I received it with the thermal glue already dried up, so I used GE silicone II to mount the extra heatsinks. If you do this, make sure the heatsink stays in place for at least a full day and let the stuff cure before using the card.
The cold plate did not make proper contact with the core on a Gigabyte 390, so that card is now useless, due to a cracked core.
On the plus side, it dropped the temperatures on an overclocked XFX 270X by 30 degrees, so it got temperatures like 30 degrees above ambient while stressed with Furmark. The overclocked 270X this was put on served me well, but it is starting to crash (driver-related blue screen) with any overclock at all. Does anyone know what could be causing this issue?
I could never hear this even with the fans on 100%.
Overall, it is a good cooler, as long as it makes proper contact with the core."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"I've purchased two of these mice.  The first lasted about 3 years before the double click issue became so frustrating it was not longer usable.  I did like the feel and other features of the mouse, so I thought I'd give it another chance and purchased another mouse.  Keep in mind this was when the price was still $45.  That mouse had the same click issue but happen much quicker, I'd say 3 months.

Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"I've owned quite a few similar sets in black, and it never occurred to me that there could be good versions and bad versions of this sort of simple product.  Well, I was wrong.  There is at least one bad version and it's this one.

Cons:
- Will not straighten out, not at all, it strongly insists on remaining curly, which makes it far less inconspicuous as it refuses to lie and kinks up
- Pinches your fingers badly, really, really badly.  Seems impossible, I know, but seriously, it hurts.  The plastic they used is just wrong for this application, it's so stiff it I'm typing this on fingers that are raw from having to spread it open to put the cables inside.
- It is NOT white, it's an off white, so it doesn't blend in as well with real white as it should.

Pros:
- Umm, there seem very few alternative products... so I guess mere existence is a pro."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"I've been using this monitor on and off now for a couple of weeks, and it's ok.  I've got it connected to a docked Lenovo ThinkPad, and so far haven't had any real issues to report.  No dead/bright/stuck pixels on the unit I received, which was a great start.  It's a very thin panel, not much weight to it at all, and the bezel is small and looks nice.  The included stand is garbage, like most at this price point - I'd recommend a VESA mount to give you more ability to adjust the height and angle.  Watching streaming video online worked well, and the screen kept up with fast motion in action movies, but brightness is an issue sometimes - best to keep this monitor in a darker room.  Overall, it's a good monitor for little money - just not great.
Pros:  Cheap, looks nice, LED backlit
Cons: No HDMI, low quality stand, brightness"
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"I've owned this wireless mouse for 3 years now, and it worked wonderfully for the first year and a half. This is a good wireless mouse for your notebook. It is small and easy to stuff into a pocket. I like the feel of this mouse; it fits snug in my hand, and doesn't feel cheaply made. The battery life is about 1-2 months if used daily. The scroll, I think, is the best part of this mouse. The quality of the scroll is good, and coherent with your actions. The reason i'm giving this a 3 stars is because the signal of the mouse got much worse over time. I was be able to use this 10 feet away without a problem when it was new, but after a while, it became choppy and would disconnect even if I were a few inches away. All in all, this is a good, cheap wireless mouse that is acceptable while it lasts."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"Don't get this if your goal is the secondary temperature gauge.  It doesn't transmit through walls!  So you would have to have the main unit in the house on one side of a window and the receiver somewhere outside mounted but not in the sun, oh and not where it can get wet, oh and not too far away, etc., etc..  There are tons of restrictions about the placement which make the secondary temperature gauge virtually useless.  Who has the PERFECT spot to mount it in relation to the main device?  I thought you could mount the temperature gauge anywhere outside but you can not.  Can't be in the sun, can't get wet, can't have X number of walls or barriers between the main unit and the other gauge.  I actually should have sent it back.  Would not recommend unless you don't care about the second gauge and if that's the case, you can find one cheaper."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"I tried these earhones and I waited and waited and finally when they came I was so happy. Well when I was trying to pull them out of their tight packaging one of them slightly snapped. They  still sounded the same, but they didn't look it. The bass is probably the only thing that is really good about these like I said before. The mids are somewhat there and the highs are almost no where to be found. The sound isolation was okay, blocking some noise while music was playing but my previous Etymotic Er6i isolators did a much better job for 40$ more. I did insert them all the way into my ears, for what seemed to be as far as they could go. All in all, if all you need is bass consider these, if not just look elsewhere.

Oh yeah, I have a newer ipod, so sound coming from it is bound to be good. So there should be no problems coming from the music side."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"Well, I've been using it for quite sometime now and I honestly don't like it very much.

The fact that I've actually bought two sets of these makes it even worse. I'll keep the review short and simple.

Pros:
1. Easy to install and use
2. Buttons light up, can turn the feature on or off

Cons:
1. Buttons lights up and off too quickly, lights do not stay long enough
2. Distance for radio signal is poor, it's best not to have interference or obstacles in front or in between the signal path
3. The mouse wheel is infrared sensor, which kind of works but not as well as a mouse wheel. It's not as precise and you almost always lose track
4. Due to poor signals, I would constantly have to type something on TV and look at the pad, then look at the TV again to make sure the signal took the input, because sometimes it would not.

Gave it 3 stars for Lenovo at least trying to improve a product but did not really do a good job."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"I so wanted to like this TV.  The first one we ordered came damaged but Amazon true to form had the damaged one picked up and a new set in our greedy little hands in under three days.  But why the one star?  Well, the set would turn on without any reason.  It wasn't a problem with other remotes or neighbors remotes, for we live in the country.  Had problems getting to customer service but when we did get them tech was nice and very helpful.  He had me do a Hard Reset.  It worked....until six hours later and it went back to turning on by itself.  I really wanted this set but in the end it was too much of a hassle.  I read many reviews and chose it for cost and star ratings.  We must have gotten one of the few lemons.  I would only recommend this set if you are buying from Amazon as they were great with return."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"I bought this mouse for use with my Surface 3. Since the Surface is pretty limited on USB slots, I thought it would be best to have a Bluetooth mouse so that I wouldn't have a dongle filling up my singular USB slot. I also wanted to have a small mouse that I could easily carry in my laptop bag. This mouse is great in terms of those two things. I was actually very happy with this mouse upon arrival. Connectivity was easy, the size was great, and the look of the mouse is nice too.

Now after 4 months of use I find that my left click is starting to stick. It's only happening about once or twice per day but I feel like it's a problem that's only going to get worse over time. I'm hoping I'm wrong but we shall see. If this started happening after even 1 year of daily use, I would feel like I had gotten my money's worth but to be happening after only 4 months is very disappointing."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"Installed easily. Just plugged it into a USB port and Windows 7 recognized it. I should have stopped there. Instead, I installed the driver on the included mini-disk. The driver installed easily, but once it was installed, Skype no longer recognized it. I uninstalled the driver - no joy. I restored my computer to pre-driver installation, no joy. I tried installing the most recent driver from their web site. The installation never finished. I kept getting messages that Windows didn't recognized the publisher, and as soon as the progress bar was full, it started all over again. I tried uninstalling the updated driver and I got messages that something was already running, and it wouldn't uninstall. I have sent Ausdom an email asking for help, but I am returning it if I don't get an immediate, helpful response. My OS is Windows 7, and it is completely up to date.

Right now, it seems the only way to get this software off my system is to completely rebuild it, and I'm not looking forward to doing that."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"I've been using this tablet for about a year. It's a good tablet for the price.  There are three problems that may affect your purchase. It does not have enough disk space. I use it mainly to read newspapers, surf the web, read email and play one game. I have Office installed. No other software yet there isn't enough space for updates.  The second problem is battery life. This says 6 hours. Maybe on standby but if you are using the tablet, expect that you'll only get 2-3 hours. Lastly the keyboard is awful. I do not have large hands but the keys are so small that I'm constantly deleting text or bringing up a pop up menu. I have a third party external keyboard that I bought to use with this and its a wireless full sized keyboard that works well. But I'm don't always have it nearby. So if you can live with these shortcomings and can get it on sale (I paid 105.00 for it), then it's worth it. Otherwise looking."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"Snapbridge is a joke bordering on fraud.  I ordered the camera and waited 8 months for delivery in order to take wildlife photos.
The remote control was vital to my work.  Spent and entire day trying to get remote control to work.  I was using an I-phone 6s and all the latest software and it wanted a wifi connection as well as bluetooth.  Either one did not work.  I am debating whether to keep the camera because it looks cool and I hope that Nikon will get its act together someday.  It is sad to see the depths to which a fine company like Nikon has sunk to.  Zoom does not properly focus so pictures appear fuzzy.  Nikon said the first delay of 3 months was caused by the earthquake and then another 5 month delay because of ""software issues"" which they obviously did not work out.  If i made claims in my business like Nikon made in selling me this camera I would be in jail for fraud."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"I loved this device when I first received it. It is slim, lightweight, had a good feel to the keys and was a USB device. However, after about a month of using it a few of the keys started to kind of stick. Next thing I knew, it was causing my computer to go crazy. I wasn't able to type using it was flashing text. As soon as I disconnected the device my computer worked perfectly again. I can only assume one of the keys was permanently stuck (although I can't figure out which one) and so it was trying to type that character over and over. I am just out of the return window and so I am stuck with it. Luckily it wasn't more expensive than it is. I believe I saw a few comments here about people with similar experiences. Please believe them as I think this is likely to happen to you too. Oh yeah, I am a very light computer user. This was only used for personal business not a work computer."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"I bought this case from a store for my new iPad (3rd gen). While it does fit, it would slip out of the smaller clips on the left side of the case that hold the device every once in awhile. Finally, after having it for only 4 days, one of the clips snapped. So, needless to say I'm looking for a new case...

Here's what I liked about the case:
 - Very thin, and didn't add much bulkiness to the device
 - Nice thick cover with soft inside, made me feel that the screen would be protected.
 - The faux-leather cover dosen't look too ""fake""

What I didn't like:
 - The band that is made to hold the device closed. I stopped using it after the first day. Don't they know that this will just break off? Plus, the cover stays closed well on it's own.
 - The small clips that hold the iPad in the case on the left side. I couldn't understand why they couldn't use a longer band to hold the device in like the right side."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"This is a good watch, but to really use it, you need to connect it to both your smartphone (via the Garmin Connect application) and a heart rate monitor (which it is often sold with as a package).

The Garmin Connect app is buggy and has been since CNET wrote it's review in 2015.  You'd think they fix it, but they haven't.  I've had to uninstall and reinstall the application on my phone twice this week and power off and power on the the phone once this week because the ""transfer failed"" message appears on the Garmin Vivoactive at the conclusion of the transfer.  In addition, there was another time where my steps would update on the application, but when I closed the application and reopened it they were lost repeatedly.

As far as the heart strap is concerned, you'd think you would be able to see the stats on the phone after it connects.  No such luck.  It connects, but there is no place to look at the data on the phone.  Someone didn't think this through."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"I was very disappointed to find that there is NO Vimeo app available, as it has been for previous models.

I am hoping this is just a temporary issue since this model just hit the market.

Unfortunately the answers from Sony are pretty much ""...thanks for asking, no details,...wait and see...""

Therefore, I would not recommend this player if you need Vimeo.

*** three month update ***
Still no Vimeo! No response from Sony support or user sites. Not good.

With moderate use, we have found that it does not crash as frequently as the previous year's model. So we don't have to pull the plug quite as often. Yes, there is no other re-boot or recovery option other than pulling the plug. Not good.

Rating now downgraded to two stars.

My advice: forget Blu-Ray, get Roku, absolutely top-notch engineering and solid software. Streaming support is blazing fast, no startup lag, quality just as good as the Sony. I've been a die-hard Sony fan since my first spectacular Trinitron TV in the 70's. It's been a sad downhill slide in the past decade, I can see why they are losing mega-bucks."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"but, then, I realized that it has no memory expandability, a small screen, and a non-replaceable battery. I wondered why. Then, I happened upon the Aiptek A-HD+ 1080P which had all those features and more. It weighs a tiny bit more, but gives much more bang for the buck. A little bit cheaper too. Not as sexy though. Anyway, I bought the Aiptek and that's that. It's well worth considering. Just a tip, IMHO.

Update to post 7/7/08: I was rightfully admonished about giving the Mino a rating without having used it. thank you for the feedback. I need to qualify my statements above by saying that my 3 star rating was based only on the Mino's features vs. its inherent limitations. That is the only basis for my rating. For what it's worth by the way, the Aiptek is great and running 720p at 60 fps. It could run at 1080p, but I haven't tried it yet. It's a very nice camera with a very good picture. I continue to recommend looking at it as you shop. Variety is the spice of life you know."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"I installed the newest firmware, and DVDs still appear very pixellated. I can watch the same DVDs on my X-Box and they are MUCH clearer. I have both players connected by component cables, but I tried with basic RCA video on a non-HDTV and the pixellation was still horribly apparent. It does play a lot of formats, but I've found that Divx or Xvid usually looks better if I convert it to a DVD using dvdSanta and watch it on the X-box. For your video files not worth a whole dvd, or to fit over 30 hours of 256k quality MP3s on one DVD, it does the job. Maybe with firmware it will get better. Also, its goes real jittery and even the menus flicker spastically if in progressive scan mode. The web site suggests turning off progressive scan mode, yet this is still advertised and labeled as a progressive scan player. Play a lot of stuff for cheap, but it shows. Especially DVDs.... I thought if nothing else DVDs would look good on a Philips player. They look better on my friend's Apex which is cheaper."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"It's a crap shoot whether or not my Alienware laptop will even boot with this thing attached. When it works, it's great, but it's so finicky that I never want to hook it up because it might take me 2 hours to get my computer started if I do. Very disappointed in this purchase.

Also, Dell makes it nearly impossible to find the software for this thing on their website. It is not detected by their support helper application and does not seem to have the ""service tag"" that is needed to find drivers and other software for your machine. There's tons of software to choose from one you do find it, but it's pure luck to download and install the correct software as everything is named the same and not labeled appropriately for specific machines and operating systems (it LOOKS like it is, but I have downloaded many packages for this device that indicate my specific laptop and OS, only to get a message that says :this software does  not work with this machine"" upon trying to install. Hugely frustrating and a gigantic fail on Dell's part."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"For today's standards, this is a nice, functional VCR that I would recommend to anybody who needs one.  But if you are looking for a comparable replacement for your 80s or 90s VCR, you will most likely be disappointed.

This LED display, for one thing, is lacking.  While VCRs used to show the tape counter while a tape is being played, rewinded, or fastforwarded, this VCR only displays the words ""PLAY"" or ""STOP"" or ""REW"", etc.  There is a very noticible delay when rewinding or fastforwarding, which can get very annoying at times.  The VCR also does not have any useful gimmicks, like Sony's Commercial Skip, that seperate it from any other brand or model.

My advice is this:  If you 1) already have a seperate DVD player for the same TV or 2) you do not plan to watch DVDs in the near future, then I would definitely buy this VCR model.  If not, then you should definitely look into buying a VCR/DVD combo, which in general do not have the problems mentioned above.  You can find an excellent one for just $100-150."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"This GPS served me fairly well (although my first update seemed to mess up its routing) for three years.  It routed in basic fashion, and did not surprise me too much.  The selection to favor back roads was especially good, and the POIs were quite extensive. Then I was recently ready to go on a long trip through the southern US and up the east coast. I was packed, turned it on and then NOTHING but the Magellan intro screen hanging there. System reset did not fix anything, and then it turned itself off.  In short, this a defective unit after three years of only occasional use. I stopped at a Walmart on the way of my trip and chose a TomTom Start 40M, which is a very nice unit that was up and running in 5 minutes. A bit quirkier than the Magellan, POIs are not as good, but it is quite smart in its routing. I expect electronics to last a lot more than three years. No wonder there are so many refurbished 1412s out there! One star ONLY for lack of durability, but that is BIG."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"Adding my voice to the negative reviews about the longevity of the cord and general construction weakness.  Do heed these warnings!  I was concerned the moment I opened the box.  I haven't seen this sort of cord design in a decade.  Most modern earbuds are designed with a rectangular device in mind, i.e. they employ an elbow shaped plug.  This one goes straight out of the unit meaning it'll constantly get bent whether you're using it with a laptop or much more so when it's plugged into an phone or music player that might be in your pocket.

And sure enough, after 9 months of careful usage, the cord failed.  (Also, long before that, the rubber sealant around the connection to the ear piece itself split on both sides not boding well for the future - tho that didn't turn out to actually cause any problems - just a premonition...)

I did love the sound - it is truly excellent, but I expect portable headphones to survive a portable lifestyle.  My previous set, an $80 pair of Sennheisers, lasted for 3 years and when it finally failed it was a speaker failure."

Another problem with the IE6 is that they're too loud (115db/V), meaning you'd need an extra volume control if you plug it into an airplane audio socket. The Sony EX36V already has a volume control built-in, and isolates outside noise better than the IE6. Still not the same sound fidelity as the PXC450, but not bad for less than $30. Go with the Sony EX36V..."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"Original headphones, left channel went dead within first two months. Company replaced them immediately. Replacement set lasted about 10 months when the plastic piece connecting the bracket to the ear piece just broke.  Exploded right off my head!  Fixed it with superglue. Two months later the exact same thing happened to the other ear piece.  Was watching a movie when they just fell off my head.  I was so mad I emailed their sales department complaining about their junk headphones.  They wanted the serial number and then requested that I send them back for a replacement.  That was four years ago. The ear pads have since flaked and disintegrated and those were replaced about three months ago.  Two nights ago, while watching a movie, they just exploded right off my head, the plastic piece connecting the ear piece to the head brace just broke.  I have finally trashed these head phones.  If you want a great set of headphones and are willing to pay $150, get the Sennheiser HD595.  Not only do they sound superior to the Bose Triports but they are made like a quality product should be."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"I have always liked Wacom products and that includes its Bamboo styluses. The one I have used before just had a pen clip which actually worked well for my iPad case. I have always liked the styluses that are able to plug into the headphone/speaker port because I don't use it often so I it makes sense to have a solid place to keep my stylus with my iPad.

This product is reminiscent of the elago, which also has the retractable and speaker port pen feature. It also includes some colored rings that you can swap out for customization, though I think the silver looks the cleanest and most expensive.

The functionality is fine. It writes well and fits in your hand well. I'm just not a big fan of the girth of the product but it does allow for better grip and writing. However, the rubber grip does make the product look a bit cheaper, as it has dots in them and holds onto lint and dirt strongly and easily.

For the price, I think the elago is a much cheaper and comparable option. This product just doesn't look as sleek and clean as the other styluses in both elago or Wacom's repertoire."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"3 months ago the case looked very luxury and looked like a case that would hold up. It hasn't completely fallen apart but there are two problems with it so far.

1. the magnets do not stay in their spot, as if the glue used isn't strong enough. Because of that the magnet moves and sets in between the leatherette.

2. the leatherette is separated because of the magnets. Also on other corners it is separating as well.

Overall I like the case and hope it doesnt fall apart completely anytime soon.

Update (June 15, 2013):

The Magnet at the top has officially feel out of the case. This iPad is used for mixed business and pleasure so it is not really used all the time. I'm the only one that uses it. But from constant opening of the case, it pulls the magnets up, therefore tearing the leatherette more and more. The bottom magnet doesnt stay in the original hole anymore and is pushing its way through the leatherette and plastic. The top you can easily peel back and put the magnet back in place but it comes right back out anyways. Its very frustrating being that the rest of the case is holding up well."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,for now ill just give it 1 star because i think i received a defective product. when i use the app on my HTC One M8 it seems slugish loading pictures or even video files. i have yet to try transfer files between the devices. when i finally managed to get a video file to play i actually watched a video for an hour. after that i the mobilelite on but was not using my phone with it 3 hours later its already blinking a red light and i charged the thing for more than 8 hours. this is definitely not what is advertised on amazon i believe it's supposed to last 13 hours streaming videos or listening to music and viewing photos on multiple devices... so i am definitely planning on returning this thing. i ordered 2 of them 1 for myself and for my father. not sure how my fathers device held up so far maybe he had better luck than me. i might try this device again but then again i might switch to the Sandisk Connect Wireless or the RAVPower FileHub. i like kingston products but this device let me down really hoping that it's just a defective product.
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"Very disappointed in this vx-981K. I had hoped to be able to do a 4k photo burst capture-the menus in the unit are difficult to navigate and understand. The manual is awful, and can't find anything on the website to help. Very misleading as to what this can do. No remote port, so you can't film a show without holding your arm up high on the zoom rocker. I had wanted to mount this on a camera boom arm-but no way to remote control it. I am going to try the Lumix G7 camera, as it has 4K photo burst capture-easy access. And it does have a remote port! When I did film, picture was over-exposed. Not sure if factory set it up this way. Anyway, the build quality seems suspect-SD card slot is underneath unit-can't change it when mounted to tripod! I wish Panasonic would make how-to videos showing all aspects of this video cameras use, instead of 2 minute promo vids with nice music. Even Youtube has mostly unboxing vids. I have used Canon G@0's for years, and Sony products as well, all have remote ports. Not sure why this new trend-maybe using smartphones to control it remotely? Hope this helps."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"Bass is muddy but acceptable in a speaker set in this price range.  If you can recall to take extreme care when assembling, disassembling, or moving this speaker set, and if you're not looking for high fidelity, this is probably a perfectly fine purchase.

My wife moved the woofer to make room while vacuuming and bumped the back of the woofer against the wall.  This broke the tweeter audio connector internally, making it so that I had to wiggle the tweeter connector cable in order to make a connection - and high volumes would shake it loose almost immediately.

Being only invested for $40 and being fairly certain the connector was probably wired separately from the circuit board, I decided to disassemble the woofer and attempt a repair.  I quickly discovered that every seam and component are glued into place - even those which are (also) screwed-down.  I also then discovered that the audio connector is part of the circuit board rather than being a separate lead-out connector.  The repair was beyond my soldering skills and though I could have taken it to a repair shop, the cost of doing so would have exceeded the purchase price of a new speaker set."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"I've had nothing but trouble with this GPS since I replaced a Garmin unit that died shortly after it's 1 year birthday (conveniently just out of warranty).
The unit takes a long, long time to acquire a satellite signal; prior to trying to find a satellite it takes a long time to actually boot; the units touchscreen requires a hammer-like touch to register; the unit frequently takes us on unnecessary and inexplicable diversions - for example when travelling from A to B on a straight road with no discernible traffic, it will direct us to turn right for a mile, then left, left again, and back onto the straight road we were on in the first place (perhaps it is sponsored by an Oil company?)  One lesser gripe is the unit's inability to figure out that ""DR"" in an address means ""Drive"" and not ""Doctor"".  There are lots of annoying issues with this unit that make it marginally usable, and of course I waited way too long to ever address any of these issues with the manufacturer as I should have done - so much so that I just realized we're beyond the 1 year warranty again.  No more Garmin for us, ever."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"I've used OtterBox before for my phones and have had nothing but great things to say about them so I was interested to see what they do with an iPad case.

Unfortunately, my experience was not the best. Don't get me wrong, the case is fantastic at what it does: protect your iPad. It's not just a good fit for how I use my iPad.

The majority of the time I use it, I'm holding it. I tried every way I could think of but the floppy folding cover was just not comfortable in my hands. A lot of the apps I use require it to be in landscape mode and the edge of the case by the home button moves away too easily when holding it this way.

Probably my biggest issue is the clasp. Maybe it's the kind of thing that will loosen up a bit with use but it is difficult to open. It's not a huge inconvenience to have to futz with it a few seconds but the fact that I have to means there is a problem.

Overall, this is a decent iPad case. It's not for me, but a lot of people have given it great reviews so maybe it'll be good for you."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"Sadly, I have tried this model again (for the 2nd time) and it still proved problematic for me. As for playing content, I agree it plays a vast number of differing file formats. But for me I encountered too many issues with this model to be a reliable solution or replacement of my older versions.

First, I want to say I own two older models (WDBAAN0000NBK) for several years and love it. My only negative is I am unable to configure them to indicate newly added content (not sure if this is doable).

Last year I tried a refurb version of the WDBYMN0000NBK-HESN and more recently purchased and returned a brand new unit. Both times I experience similar problems. Frequent glitches such as freeze-ups, audio mis-syncs and the inability to display multiple NAS devices simultaneously (to change NAS you need to go through several nested steps). I do not have any of these issues with the older models. To a lesser extent I too am not excited about the GUI as it appears to be trying too hard to be good looking more than functional.

I really hoped for this newer version to be more satisfying experience than the previous generations but for me that is not the case."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"I've now had this TV for a year. It has been nothing short of a nightmare. I have a sony ps3 and an iPhone. Streaming to it from the phone is hit or miss. My internet is well over spec for this to function but it barely ever does. Most days we decide to watch something on the TV it just doesn't want to work.  The playstation is wired to it and gets unrecognized by the TV so often and decides not to work anymore. Yes my ps3 works just fine on real tvs. It's updated as much as it can be. There is just no reason to make such a dumb product as this. Why can't it just be a TV and play whatever I play on it? Sony has killed my enthusiasm for all things entertainment. When it works, the image and sound are fantastic. If you don't mind being let down 6 out of ten times you try using it, that might work for you.

I'm writing this now because I thought at first it was my inexperience with this kind of product that caused issue. But the internet and streaming technology can't be blamed for the issues with sony's own gaming console.  zero stars."

Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"I purchased a system from Lorex and when I opened the box, it was missing parts, so Lorex said that I had to purchase $50 worth of parts (power cord, remote control & mouse) to make it work. Yes... those items should have been in the box (as stated on the box). After buying the parts and plugging it into an outlet, it did not work. Lorex does not want to replace or refund it. I have been fighting with Lorex for over a year about this. I went to Wal-Mart and purchased a system that I installed and had working in just a few minutes. Save your time & money, go to Wal-Mart and get a different system (not made by Lorex). I wish that someone would have warned me about Lorex and they way they treat customers.

Also, if you have a problem with Lorex products, you are told to submit a (claim) ticket on-line. After they can't or better yet ""won't"" help, they cancel your ticket and if you want to continue to fight them, you have to submit another ticket. Like I said, I have been fighting with them for over 1 year (they cancel my tickets)... do you want to do that to?????????????????? Just thought I would help."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"This mount lasted only about 2 years and it was placed under a protective eavestrough.  The biggest problem is that it is made almost exclusively for VERTICAL mounting (non very ""universal"").  Although I was able to get it positioned in a way that would allow a mount perpendicular to the siding, I would definitely NOT recommend it.  It is difficult to adjust, and it tends to slip.  In fact, even in a vertical position, the outer mount collar has an annoying tendency to rotate.  There is a thumb type knob, but this is practically useless.  There is also a screw ""port"" in the other side, and if it were possible to thread something in there, you might get better stability.  But nothing has been provided, and I've tried a wide range of metric and english bolts to no avail.

I actually bought two and never used the one, so when the first mount began to fail I used the second for spare parts.  Then I found they are not made quite the same way.  The worst part, is even light torquing of the camera mount screw will cause it to SHEAR off!  Nasty, junk.

Really a frustrating piece of crud to work with.  Keep looking."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"This is my third foray into the world of inexpensive HD cameras.  About two years ago I bought a similar sized and priced Sony model - and I like the Sanyo much better.  The Sony used tape, which was less convenient, and the interface to my computer was terrible in comparison to the Sanyo.  The video quality for both is comparable.

At Christmas I also bought a Flip HD.  I love the convenience and the computer interface for the Flip, and because of its size I tend to use it much more than the Sanyo.  They Sanyo certainly has many more features for a little more money, so which one you would buy depends on your situation.

If you often shoot video at the last minute, and are less concerned about quality (though for its size the Flip looks great) than you are about ""capturing the moment"" - I would buy the Flip. You can literally stuff it in a shirt pocket or your glove box and it is there if you need it. Ditto if you want a really simple interface and an easy to use camera.

If you instead want to create some better home videos, and a little bigger camera with more features is appealing, then buy the Sanyo."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,The Acer Aspire I bought has 2gb ram and overall is quite fast enough for my uses and with all my Microsoft Office products.  The wireless works very good and I love the unit. I am an usually an Apple guy and really wanted a Mac Air but being that I had to buy an out drive to load software and watch DVDs plus tax I was looking at $1300 +/- a few dollars.  I decided that since I only really use this for traveling this would be a better deal and that it was.  The big negative on this unit however is the touch pad which is terrible and almost unusable to me and I have to use a mouse to really do anything or else you go crazy wasting time trying to point and click to the areas you want.  The pad just is not sensitive enough even after I adjusted as much as possible.  With the mouse it works great and it's really no big deal at least in the way I use it but if I had to continually use this with just the pad I would dump it for something else in a minute.  Overall though it is a a very good machine though.
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"UPDATE 8/8/2012: I haven't had the case/cover for 3 months, yet...and it's already showing signs of falling apart. I use the case/cover at home and for one class I'm taking, and after a short 3 months it's surface material is cracking and starting to peel off where the cover folds (multiple locations). I do like the case, but it's going to look very ratty in a few more months. At this rate I'll need a case every 3-4 months and that quickly ads up over a year's time frame (which would be an acceptable amount of time for a single case/cover to survive).

Old Review: Great case for the iPad. This thing goes in and out of my back pack, loose leaf binder, and around campus. It's a simple design-in black-and most folks don't know it's an iPad until I open the cover. I just need to learn and not show off, so this fits the need perfectly. I would have given 5 stars, but I find the cover sometimes moves enough that the unlock screen will come on. In a side-by-side comparison, the Apple screen cover has about twice the hold of this one, but this one protects the whole device and helps my hands grip what would otherwise be the difficult to handle smooth aluminum back."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"I bought my first set of these headphones about a year ago.  I was able to look past the annoyingly long right ear wire because they do have excellent sound quality.  I used them mainly at the gym and noticed that after being on the treadmill for a few minutes that the combination of sweat and the weight of the cord would pull the left earpiece out.  I tried all 3 rubber sizes but was constantly pushing that left piece back in.  Also, when lifting weights I run the cord under my shirt and found that the thick rubber piece where the right and left earphones split would catch my shirt and again pull the left earpiece out, even more often than while running.  This was annoying, but I would still have rated these 4 stars because walking my dog or listening in bed these were the best phones I ever heard.  I bought 2 other pairs as Christmas presents last year, and now all 3 pairs have failed in one ear.  I tried re-soldering the wires and got 2 of them to work again, who knows for how long.  I have switched to a pair of Ultimate Ears and the quality is even better, hopefully these will last longer."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"I have 4 tablets; HP G2 10"" android; Dell Venue Pro 8"" windows; Vulcan Excursion 10"" windows and an Ipad Mini-2.  These work on the Ipad about 60% of the presses I make.  The Dell they work on about 1 in 5 times I press it to the surface.  The HP they work about 7 our of 10 times and the Vulcan hardly at all.  I don't know why they act this way.  I have an iHome stylus/pen (looks like a pen with the rubber tip at the top part) and it works 80-100% across all devices.  The company is great, they send follow up emails and the package is nice.  I only received 1 lanyard but it's ok; I didn't contact them to send another.  For me at 7-bucks they're thrown in the drawer and my iHome pen is clipped in my Venue Pro case.  They're built well but just don't work great on any of the 4 tablet devices I have, eh?  Get 'em if you've tried a friends on your device and they work. For me, not so much and if I require another stylus it'll be a 2nd iHome pen/stylus.  Great contact/sales follow-up; product about the cost of a burger lunch and as memorable."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"2013-08-04 Update - They worked great for about a month.  Two weeks ago, the one side stopped working. It works at the beginning of the run, the stops after about 2 miles.  It will work again the next day.  I have tried everything.  Once, on a longer run, it did restart towards the end of the run.  This was my first, and now last, Philips purchase.  I just don't understand how the quality control could be so poor.

Original Review
Have been trying to find an inexpensive headset like the Nike pair that I had and loved.  These are not as inexpensive as the Nikes but if they last longer, they will be worth it.

I like them and plan to stick with these - have had to return a couple of types I recently bought.  The sound is good, not  great, but for running and podcasts its what I need.  They are very comfortable.  You can wear them both over and under the ear, which is really nice. The cord gets in the way a bit if you wear your phone/mp3 on your arm but there is clip that helps keeps it out of the way.  The cord is a good length if you are keeping the phone/mp3 in your pocket."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"I bought this for my Windows 7 Desktop PC.  I was tired of running a cord from my router in the bedroom to the living room where the PC resides.  I have a Linksys e3000 Router which is a top of the line router.  I wanted a wireless USB device which would allow me to have a full 300MB/s connection.  This one fit the bill and was reasonably priced so I went with it.  After downloading the right drivers from the web I was set to go.  Unfortunately, I could not get a connection higher than 130MB/s.  It seems this device will only work at the full 300MB/S on the 2.4GHz band (not the 5GHz band) and only at the wider channel widths.  I set my router up this way but this would still not pick up at the full 300MB/s.

This would have been bad but not a deal breaker.  But then the device would not keep a stable connection.  It would keep dropping the connection despite the fact that the router was working just fine.  Confirmed this by using my iPad, iPhone, and my Windows laptop to connect to my router every time the connection went down.  They all worked fine.

Given these problems I decided to return the device."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"For starters the head phones worked and were way better in staying in the ear when doing laps and flip turns. The packaging was great, and they came with all sorts of swap out buds for all different size ears. The problem and the reason I'm writing this review, is I noticed that about 2 weeks after receiving them and using them in my daily 1 mile swim, that one of the headphones was barely working. I thought it may be due to water getting in my ear and drowning out the noise. This wasn't the problem because the very next day the ear bud stop working permanently.  I found that i can get the broken side to work if i bend the wire that plugs into the Ipod. So all in all, I'm very disappointed in this product you would think that for $40 (usd) you would get a pair of water proof headphones that would be built to last. I do understand that even normal headphones don't last forever!!! but they are like $10. Hope to hear back from the company. I will write an update review in a few weeks, in response to company actions. I would also like to note that im also deployed overseas and received these headphones with amazon prime in under a week, it was amazing."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"My first impression when I opened the box that contained this bag was: WOW, GODZILLA.

First, I really didn't care for the metal framing. I thought it made the bag bulky, and unconfortable.  Sure it makes the bag sturdier, but I'm not planning to use my camera backpack as a weapon in a battery assault.  Second, it is not really as spacious as you might think.  The camera compartment is really hard to access since the flap won't stay open on its own when the bag is laid on the ground.  You'll have to hold the flap open, while getting your camera or lense.  Third, the opening for the camera (the way it is designed to open) just makes me cringe.  Even though there is another zipped cover net behind that front flap, I just don't like the fact that anyone walking behind you at the airport can freely open that part of the bag and steal my camera so easily.  In my opinion, the design looks very very cool, it's just very very illogical.

I'm glad to see many people like this bad, and I hope it continues to work well for them.  But this one is not for me.  I'd rather save my money for more expensive lenses, than a more expensive bag and crappy equipment."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"I got these because they look great, like equipment you might find on the spaceship in 2001: A space Odyssey.  I was tempted to keep them just for that. The problem is that I don't like using them.

For this price I didn't expect them to sound great, and they don't, but they are good enough for audio books and podcasts. Turns out they are uncomfortable for me. I think they could be comfortable with velour pads instead of the synthetic leatherette material. I think the leatherette material is meant to provide sound isolation, but in fact these headphones offer no appreciable sound isolation.

The biggest problem is the severe cord noise. I hear this noise even with small head movements. Heretofore, I had heard this kind of noise only with earphones (in-ear monitors), never with headphones. It's strange that only one other reviewer has complained about the cord noise with these headphones.

I might add that these headphones are larger than they look in the photo. They are large enough that I'd almost call them clunky. They are much larger than the better-sounding Sennheiser PX100, which are my favorites in lightweight portable supra-aural headphones.

If somebody helps me be able to do that, I'll be glad to add back at least another star.

At least one of the cables failed, which MAY have been partly my fault, but it just seems like they're pretty brittle and easily damaged. (Maybe really thin wire? Not sure.)

I added a 2TB surveillance hard drive, and getting all of that hooked up was rather simple - no problems there.

I was able to go rewind and see who got into my garage trash can (neighborhood stray dog), and we feel like just having the cams up is deterring whomever MIGHT have been getting stuff out of our garage freezer.

Overall, I've been a little frustrated about a couple of things, but generally pleased with this purchase."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"I have had this keyboard for a year. I bought it because it is light and thin.  It succeeds in both those areas. The protruding hinge doesn't really bother me although it is not elegant.  The rest of the keboard actually is kind of cool.  I like the tilting mechanism when it is open. Some complain that the ipad falls out of the keyboard slot. It does occasionally but it works pretty well in general.  Now for the negative...and it has become big enough for me that I can't recommend the device.  The ipad and keyboard, when in the closed position, does not clasp shut.  The ipad rests in the closed position on top of the keyboard.  It easily slides off, but more often, it moves just enough to turn the ipad on and wear down the battery.  At least once or twice a week, I go to use it and it is dead because it just sat on for 12 hours. You can't see that it is turned on.  It is so frustrating. I don't know why they didn't make a clasp or connector to keep the thing closed.  Normal travel is bound to jar it open just enought to turn it on. Ugh.  If you can manage keeping it closed (or completely turn off the ipad each time) the keyboard works well.  Thats it."

In video you can see its warranty seal isn't broken. and its inside is clean because it was unstable/defective power supply , so it has been hardly used as I also have dual xeon mac pro also. on top of headaches the power supply cause me I have to ship defective PSU on my own cost."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"I purchased 3 of them with great expectations.  Using supplied sortware, I got only one camera on my computer, and could not get the other 2 on with it. At set up, I tried using: first Wireless and later with cable 5e.  Just could not get them to work all together. I gave up and they are sitting unplugged in the corner for over 2 months.

Anyway, when you can get all 3 on supplied software on my PC, instructions want you to go into the Router security system's guts and change access for external viewing. We depend on the router for our living, working from home when away from office, and we dare not tamper with the internal setting of our router and risk loss of work and income.  A big mysterious disappointment.

I may buy another router, taking our main router off line , and trying to get the cameras to work with a 2nd router.  If I mess up internet connection  with that 2nd router (while trying open access on the 2nd router for internet viewing) I can always take the 2nd router off-line and plug back in our old, great working, reliable router. I may try that next month.

My friend got one camera to work in his home, but he did a work around requiring his home computer to be on all the time when he wants home viewing while away from his laptop."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,I consider myself more then just a novice when in comes to the ins and outs of installing hardware and software.  But this one has so far managed to elude me.  I have an Asus P6T v1 and needed the SATA III along with the RAID capability.  I might note that my MB has two onboard RAUD controllers one of which is in use.  After about 26hrs straight of messing around with this thing I am positive there is some setting that I can't find or change that allows me to have both the RAID card and the onboard RIAD running at the same time.  I was able to get the RAID card to install and even managed a RAID0 config with windows installed.  But for some reason I am no longer able to get back into that windows config.  So I am trying my hardest to see a point in keeping this harware.  Tech support at High Point seem to be unable to give me an answer as to what settings I should be shooting for in both of the BIOS for the MOBO and the card.  Bottom line is relly unless you have a ton of time and a load of asprin I wouldn't suggest going for this card... I'll update if I manage to find some kind of solution but as it is it is far from plug and play.
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"I have had many Sony Walkman's over the years. The sound on this one simply does not compare. It is an easy to operate, fairly sturdy device, but in my opinion is way over priced for what you get. And that isn't the main issue. The problems started after I had it for a few months. I would plug it into the my computer and it would not register as a connected device. It would charge and show the battery screen on the Walkman but the computer couldn't detect it. I had to plug it in and unplug is several times to get it to work. Then it stopped registering no matter what I did. I wondered if my computer driver was corrupted..even though it worked fine on other devices.  When I bought a new laptop and tried to connect it again...same problem. It would charge but fail to go to the screen that showed it was being detected so I could not load music. It would instead either attempt to play a song or go to the charge screen without registering on the computer. I went into settings and used ""restore factory settings"". It made no difference. I then used the hard reset on the unit in hopes that would work. No go. If these were not priced so outrageously I might chalk this up to a bad unit and buy another, but for what you get...and with the issues I have had....not worth it."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"Pros. 1. Feels like 'quality'. has some heft to it. gives you a warm, fuzzy when you first take it out of the box. 2. Lots of accessories. everything you need to get started vice a  SD card is in the box. including a short HDMI cable. Cons. 1. Terrible video quality. just terrible. grainy  and washed out. you will not be able to read a license plate of a car parked just in front and to the left or right of you. 2. Operation is not intuitive. crazyest sequence of button pushes I've ever experienced. the 'OK' button is not always 'Ok'. button pushing is on par with entering a cheat code in a video game console. I. e. UP, DOWN, MODE, UP, OK, MENU, MODE , UP, DOWN, UP, UP. argghh. 3. Freezes constantly. tape a paper clip to the side of it as your going to need to reset it constantly. 4. Received a used or open box unit. everything was there, but there were fingerprints all over the lense, the instruction manual was all bent to crap,  the protective film and zip lock bags the originally held the pieces where all at the bottom of the box. This was returned (and would have been anyway since it was pre-owned/used). I have ordered a main-stream GARMIN to take its place."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"Cons:
Biggest con: cables sometimes not long enough. Also, it REQUIRES A DRIVER. Will not work properly without it.
I got this unit so I can run a dekstop and laptop together. A few things to note... the vga cables are short an dthe attached usb cable is short but appears to work on most pc's as long as the ports needed are open. The vga cable being short meant that I had to purchase a vga extension cable.
As mentioned switching isn't instantaneous etc.
5 second delay to get the mouse recognized.
Also I may be wrong but the usb appeared to be needed to be plugged in for the switch to work or detect.
At the beginning I also encountered trouble with installing the driver.
The windows 7 machine works flawlessly. The xp machine appears to not detect that the belkin is connected. However it still outputs a signal and works. I just can't use software switching. Only the hardware using the button.
Also the monitor plugs are tough to connect but work fine.

Biggest pro:
The big simple switch. I wish it was longer to reach me but the switch is very useful. Just tapping it with my foot does the job. I haven't tried out the audio so I can't comment on how well it works. I also haven't tried connecting usb 2 devices to it.
I give it 3 stars because of the software trouble and trouble getting it to install correctly. But it really is a remarkable device and it does what it sets out to do."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"Pros- Great picture, slim design, light weight, 3d conversion is pretty cool.
Cons- Samsung App store is a joke, at best.  If you are only buying the TV for that, wait for a while to see if ""Smart TV's"" really take off.  No one is writing apps for them yet and the ones that are out are pretty lame/useless/not fun.  Even the YouTube app doesnt work with the keyboard side of the TV remote...fail.

Update (a little over one year later 12/30/2012)
Picture is still amazing and the small edges set this TV apart; best i've ever seen...it does have 240hz refresh rate (not CMR...what a joke).
The app store has not gotten much better.  I enjoy the CNET app, which is pretty much the only one I've downloaded after the fact that was worth anything.

Oh...3d glasses are HORRIBLE.  They do not last.  I have 1/4 that is still alive after a year.  The 2 i bought seperate from the TV (same model number as the ones that came with) didn't work all that great the moment i took them out of the box.
Even if they were working properly, don't expect to make it all the way through a long movie like Avatar without them dying on you.  that is awkward when you have to offer your pair to one of your guests and then they know you are sitting there watching a blurry picture.

Update 4/17/2013
Smart Hub still stinks.  Samsung, please push a complete software update to these models!!"
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"seSo I've owned this about a month. I was so impressed by the specs when placed next to the cost it was an easy win. I was concerned ONLY about the issue regarding the hinge but as just about every laptop has a downside I thought I'd risk it. Well I'm feeling pretty bad about this because though the price seems good for the specs a $1200 laptop is not budget and the three things I depend on every time I turn on the unit is DISPLAY, TRACKPAD AND KEYBOARD. Keyboard is a biggie for me and I give it a favourable rating. Trackpad is giving me hell. I had a great time with the synaptics software on my the lenovo I traded this in for. But the software that supports this trackpad is oversenstive. Cursor flies all over the place doing all kinds of madness while I'm typing. Constantly stopping to undo what it has done. Not a soul at ASus has replied to that query. Display was NEVER  a feature I spend alot of time on before because displays just did what displays should do but this yellow tint on the unit that so many other complain of that I didn't realise before makes my eyes hurt. I have done all I can do to calibrate but nothing really helps.

The cheapest of laptop provides a better viewing experience - colourwise. WHAT is the point of this wonderful resolution of 3200 x 1800 if the colour accuracy is piss poor and your eyes deteriorate."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"I was really looking forward to this Vantec hard drive dock because I have several Vantec products from years past that have nicer streamlined designs and built solid compared to the competitors.  I figured this new hard drive dock would have a similar solid feel.  But the FIRST TIME I attempted to remove a 2.5"" drive, the door flap broke off!  The drive got snagged against the door flap and it took only a slight pressure to pop it off and break the plastic.  Then I realized that this plastic flap is not even necessary, it's just an alignment guide, so I removed it as shown in the photo to expose a larger opening.  It is easy to line up with the SATA connector to insert a 2.5"" drive even without this silly door flap (unless someone is blind or working in the dark).  I am happy with this hot rod ""mod"" to the unit.  Now the next disturbing aspect is how bright the LED is.  I mean this thing lights up the entire room!  I can use it as a flashlight.  I don't understand why the neighbor down the street has to be able to see the LED shining through my window blinds.  Other than that, it works nicely with excellent plug-and-play capability and transfer rates.  On the bottom of the unit it says Made in China which explains the quirks.  I hope Vantec will see this review for the next design model."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"Before you go jumping off into Hightech Hysteria, think about what you want to do with what you might be buying. It's almost worthwhile to consult someone who has an iPad or someone who can guide you to what would work best in you personal daily use. This is in most cases not going to replace a laptop, or a desktop computer. The size of the screen is really nice, but then you can't put it in a suit jacket pocket. Nice to have with you, Yes. Easy to leave laying somewhere, Yes. Work with major programs, such as Adobe or FileMaker, only in an emergency and only if the program exists for the iPad (up until now only some mini versions exist). Make sure what you want to primarily want to do, really exists, this i not Mac OS X, this is iOS 4.3. If staying online is that important AND you don't mind carrying it around (it's not heavy, but it's bulky), then you could consider this gadget. It's like a sports car, it's nice to have, but it's not a necessity. What would be nice is something between the iPad 2 and the iPhone / iPad Touch sized iPad mini, that would be half the screen size of the iPad 2. This way, it might not fit in all suit jacket pockets, but could be carried in a shoulder holster or similar carrier under the jacket, sweater or what have you. The larger size to accommodate the over 40 seeing problem and big finger dilemmas."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"My last camcorder was sharp mini camcorder and I hate to buy tapes.  This camcorder sounds like a perfect fit.  I was pretty impressed with the quality of this when I saw someone took some video with this camera, and it was downsized too.  For $299 at amazon, I thought why not jump into the deal and I brought a 8gb sdhc card also.

I first took some video indoors at the highest settings and I noticed some noise when I took it, even with the flourscent light on.  Okay, I know about other reviewers who has problems taking videos in low light.  I took some pictures at the highest settings with the flash on and the pictures has alot of noise also.  Even most cameras with a flash can take decent pictures.

Took the camera outside on a bright sunny day with the highest settings and the videos didn't come out what I expected.  It was kind of noise when I took it and it wasn't as good as one of the reviewers showed.  The video quality was almost the same as my old minidv camcorder.  However, I looked at the pictures and it came out fine.  Then again, most other 7.1 digital camera should have no trouble taking pictures outside in a sunny day also.

I guess that I can't complain too much since I paid $300 for this camcorder but maybe if the quality is as good as advertised (even outdoors) I would give it 4 stars or more."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"Before I got this device I needed three remotes to control my tv/home theater system. Now that I have it I need... three remotes to control my tv/home theater system.
I'll give them one of the controllers - only my tv's original remote controls aspect ratio (my educational dvds are in 4:3) and I am unaware of universals that fulfill that function.
But this remote won't allow me to change the input on my receiver. I still need the original receiver remote to do that. If there is a way to do it, I haven't figured it out. And although the manual says they are ready to assist by phone or emai, they don't answer the phone, nor emails.
btw, if you set up the power button to punch through and turn on more than one device, you have to learn the timing. If you press the button too quickly the entire macro won't run and not all devices will turn on. If you press it too long the macro will continue running and turn some devices back off. In either case you will be out of sync, and can only get back in sync manually (or by using an original remote) to get the devices lined up in the proper on/off state as designed by your macro.
  I'll keep the remote because the power button on the original receiver remote has gone south and I need that functionality. Otherwise this remote solves no problems for me, and now I have to operate the system for those family members who are not ""technical""."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"I got a Kindle for Christmas and wanted to get a cute, but protective cover for it.  I did a lot of research, and M-Edge seemed to get really high reviews, so I bought one.

I got the fuchsia cover. It looks much different on my computer monitor than it does in person. On the monitor it looks more like a rose pink, but in reality it's a super bright, neon pink. I love pink, but I don't want it to stand out THAT much. It's really, really bright.

I knew this cover wasn't leather (unfortunately), but once I touched it I was disappointed in the feel of it.  Yes it is soft and smooth, but it looks and feels like plastic ""Pleather."" It really does have a bad over, but I was spoiled by leather in the past. No, it's not leather... but I knew that when I bought it, so I can't hold that against it.

Overall, I think the design of this cover is fabulous. I love how it incorporates the E-Luminator (sold separately). It's quite a slick design. I love that I can store the E-Luminator right in the case.  I also love the strap that keeps the book securely closed or open.  It folds back on itself like a dream, and is very comfortable to hold either open or folded back. The inside has a nice microfiber suede-like lining that offers protection against scratches.

It's a great case.. really great, if you don't mind the plastic cover.  I am hoping that they will offer leather versions in the future, and more color choices."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"I've installed SmartThings in my home about a week ago and it already feels a waste of money. The original ads looked promising, but they have just one problem: little of this will work for you. The main problem of this kit is that you're very unlikely to force it doing anything useful.

THE GOOD
-Sensors and the hub look better than many other plastic junk boxes out there.
-The customer support works great. +1 star for that.
-Bundled ""things"" are very easy to connect.
-It sometimes works.

THE BAD
-The app has a decent look, but a terrible design: it's very confusing and often feels stupid.
-To make things worse the app will prompt you to buy extra stuff without being able to run a single scenario.
-Scenarios (here they're called apps) are both useless and confusing. Just need to pair a motion sensor and light? Good luck finding an easy way to do that.
-Sonos and Philips HUE support works. Only in beta. And only if you consider such (mis)behavior a ""work"".
-Bundled manual refers to the old version of the app. But who cares if it's useless anyway?

THE UGLY
-I've spent nearly 40 minutes trying to connect the hub to the app. I'm neither mentally limited nor twisted handed, but the whole process is so confusing that I'm not sure I'll be able to repeat it again.
-Good luck making the basic kit doing anything more useful than sending you an SMS when someone opens the door.

While this might have been a good introduction to home automation, SmartThings are in fact a useless trinket for a few geeks who might have fun solving all the puzzles within its clunky app."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"UPDATE (3/12/15)
Well if you look below and see Sony's response.... what a lame reply.
I like how the comment is just ""sorry"".....  why wouldn't the organization try to make it right?
Your smart response would have been to say ""email me and I will send you a lens cap"".
Or "" here is what you can buy on Amazon that fits"".
Hey Sony.... now you really blew it....now everyone can see how stinky your ""after purchase"" customer service is.... sheesh, what a joke.
And you can be sure I will share this story with everyone I can......

Original Review:
Well I have had this camera for 1.5 years and have to say it takes amazing pictures.
It's a nice step up from some of the other point/shoot brands and it is a perfect size to grab and take with anywhere.
Fits well into small bags, purses etc

Here is my sole complaint but it is huge one.....
There is zero info on the lens size so finding a replacement lens cap.... has been a nightmare...... sigh!!
I wasted tons of time talking to the ""product experts"" at Sony (they're not very bright about their own products) who cannot find the lens size.
Tried a few camera stores and not had any luck finding a replacement cover b/c the lens is not threaded....
That means I have to order one from Sony, pay their ridiculously high price for a new lens cap.
What a ""post-purchase"" drag this has been!
Lesson leaned.... I will stick with other brands now that have more main stream camera parts so a simple thing like buying a replacement lens cap is not a big hassle......
You've lost all my future business on this Sony....."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"These screen protectors definitely do their job, as do most; however, I just can't seem to justify these for my Kindle Touch. (Especially in consideration of a few outstanding faults)

The most annoying aspect of this particular product was that it was not a very precise fit whatsoever. The Kindle Touch uses a good deal of perimeter screen area for display, which makes having nearly one centimeter clearance on each side of a centered screen protector application extremely annoying and difficult to overlook. If they were perfectly clear, it may be a little easier for others to overlook, but the translucence is ever so slightly different than the screen itself. I removed my screen protector immediately after application.

I must note that I often and gladly employ the use of screen protectors whenever reasonably applicable, particularly with touch screen cell phones, but when it comes to the Kindle Touch I'm not too sure if they truly serve any degree of necessary function at all. With most book-like e-reader covers (mine being the standard ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Amazon-Kindle-Touch-Leather-Cover-Black/dp/B004SD22PQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Amazon Kindle Touch Leather Cover, Black</a>"" - of which I am EXTREMELY happy with), the only time the screen is actually exposed would be when the Kindle is in use. In this case, the annoyance of a poorly fitting screen protector doesn't come close to outweighing the slim risk of anything happening to the screen in conjunction with a proper cover and/or case.

In summation: If you find that you need a screen protector and don't mind that it only covers 95% of the screen, then this product should certainly suffice - 3 stars for the sake of advertised purpose fulfillment."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"I purchased this for around $130 as a back up. I figure, I am spending this much money, it oughtta be a pretty decent unit. Well, while it stores information, the transfer rate is HORRIBLE, even when plugged into a USB 2.0 certified port. While trying to access this HDD through my computer, it takes anywhere from 5-15 seconds for all the information to register on the HDD. In other words, when you click to access the HDD, none or only part of what is stored on the HDD is available until it loads fully, which can take as much as 15 seconds. The thing is, is that there is still about 1.25TB left, so transfer rates should NOT be this slow. I expected this to respond much faster. I would say that to transfer 60GB it takes about an hour. I can transfer files between my 700GB Caviar Black and 640GB Caviar Blue WAAAAAAY faster than from my Black to this. And the Caviar Black is a pretty speedy little HDD. Is this something that should be expected from large storage units?

Bottom line, if you have the ability to spend a little more for a better unit, I suggest doing so. Perhaps I got one that isn't functioning to its full potential. Perhaps I don't know how to use a PnP device... Hahaha. Right. At least it stores the information.

3.29.2012 Update

Now that I have had it for some time, I would still have purchased another unit. HOWEVER, hooked up to my laptop, it operates much better than on my PC. Not quite sure why this is, but doesn't really matter. At this point I would not call it horrible, just unsatisfactory."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"I decided to jump on the chromebook bandwagon since so many people were raving about it. I will say that if you're used to having a Windows laptop and expect this to feel the same, you will be very disappointed. Sure you can check your email, browse the web or watch YouTube, but that's as far as it goes. It's capabilities won't really go past that. I wanted to Skype, and I could... If I went to their site each time and used their web extention. No option to download the app to make Skype just one click away. The same happened when I wanted to get a torrent downloader. None work with chromebook, and extentions that might have were a hassle to figure out. I didn't have a fresh goat or virgin to sacrifice on hand to make this task seamless. Not being able to download popular apps for all of my favorite things was the ultimate deal breaker for me. Some people will say you can do anything on a chromebook you can do on a windows or Mac laptop, but who wants to spend their day finding loop holes in a new system. I want simple with an easy user interface.

The good side; if you don't want all the fancy bells and whistles and just feel like browsing the web and checking your email, this will be perfect for you. If you have a Gmail account, you'll love it even more with the way it integrates your account with everything made by Google. Just don't try to watch a dvd or listen to a CD since thus has no disk drive. But hey, the battery does last an awful long time."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"Terrible product.

Does not support ""Wireless AP"" mode. Even if you manually disable DHCP, turn off SPI firewall, plugin  using LAN ports, it still restricts access to lan devices.

Also, it has LOTs of bugs including:
-Cannot allow WAN administration  from any BOGON networks. It looks like you can, but then errors out. Before applying settings
-By default it has vLAN tagging on port 3 and 4. but documentation does not tell you.
-Web admin interface is NOT httpS, and has no option to enable https.
-DNS is forcefully bound to the WAN port, thus to use it as a Wireless AP you must have a LAN cable attached... AND a LAN cable.
-Wireless defaults to use captive portal, even with guest Network turned off. So you have to enable guest Network, disable captive portal, click save, then disable guest Network again and NOW the non-guest network will work like it should. GAH! No way should anyone have to deal with this junk...

I have been trying to tell myself to just accept this devices issues, but even after hours of changing settings, it is impossible to make it work like it is supposed to. It is not even consistent, sometimes it will not let you connect, or will start dropping packets, so I have to use my old wireless as it, while older technogy, is reliable.

ONLY good thing about this device... the wireless range is very good. Unfortunately because some days it decides to just drop packets randomly, the range benefit is useless :(

*Note: TP-Link devices are ONLY good if you wipe original firmware and use OpenWRT. I have an older WDR4300 and a WDR810, with OpenWRT they work well... just old technology, unfortunately because Archer C9 uses Broadcom chip you cannot use OpenWRT."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"This case is lightweight, feels good in the hands, and installation is as easy as described; just push the iPad gently into the inside and listen for the snaps.  Thats about all the good I can actually think of for this product, however.

This case's advertising is very, very misleading.  The description states that it provides a ""secure closure"" to the iPad for the auto wake and sleep functionality.  What it actually does is lay limp and lifeless across the face of the iPad like a drunkard on the floor at the end of a Christmas party, doing no one any real good whatsoever.  When I read ""secure closure,"" I thought that it meant that there were magnets in the corners of the cover that would provide a secure closure of the cover to the face of the iPad and actually protect the screen from scratches while traveling, like almost all iPad portfolio type cases provide.  I was sorely mistaken.

If you just want a cheap, lightweight yet relatively good looking case for your iPad Air, then sure it will probably make you very happy.  If your looking for a case that will actually do what it promises to do and actually provide a secure closure of the lid to the screen of the iPad, then no, this case will make you very angry and, given that the lid does not provide secure closure, this does not bode well for the iPad.

The only thing thats providing me ""secure closure"" in this transaction is that Amazon has a wonderful returns policy and I will be getting a full refund for the item so that way I can find an iPad portfolio case that does work as it should."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"Bought this because I thought it was time to upgrade my old Harmony One. The physical Harmony Home remote is fantastic. I love the simple design, love the fact that you can program buttons to do two different things depending on if you long press or short press. Love that it's RF. If Logitech threw an LCD and backlight on this thing, it would be the best remote they've ever created.

Where the problems begin is there's no LCD on the remote. Your smartphone is supposed to take on that task and unfortunately, the app that makes this possible just sucks. Sometimes it's slow to connect to the hub, sometimes it crashes, sometimes the hub just stops responding to it. More often than not, I would grab the OEM remotes because it was so much faster and less frustrating. That's not a good sign.

I actually managed to put up with the app for a while, but the thing that had me running back to my Harmony One was when something gets out of sync (happens more than you think), there's no ""help"" button on the remote. I had to dig my phone out, unlock it, launch the app, wait for it to find the hub, hope the app doesn't crash, then fix the sync problem. This would take me 2 seconds to fix with my old Harmony One. With Harmony Home, it takes a good minute.

I don't like the direction Logitech is going with the smartphone thing. They need to focus on making good physical remotes. Does anyone really enjoy using their smartphone as remote? It's clumsy and takes too long to do anything with. I cringed every time I needed to launch the Harmony app to do something. I need tactile buttons Logitech!"
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"I got this as a Christmas gift for my wife after one of the grandkids broke the screen on her last one.  Not very pleased with the quality of the cameras or the screen resolution but it does what she wants it to do. The colors are great it's just a little grainy if your looking at pictures or watching a video and the pictures from the camera are very grainy.  This was a disappointment to her because she likes to take it when we go hiking and use it for pictures.  This one won't work well for that due to poor camera quality. I wanted to get the same one she had but couldn't find it on amazon.  Maybe they don't sell it anymore.  The tagital seems to respond fast enough for browsing the net and playing her games.  The touch screen is sensitive enough.  We only had one issue after a few hours.  It worked great with the included keyboard at first then last night it wouldn't boot up, kept getting an error message.  Then we unplugged the keyboard and it booted correctly.  Haven't tried the keyboard again to see if it was a fluke or the keyboard actually went bad.  The included case is very nice and I like the way the tablet actually is snapped in place.  Much more secure than the one she had with her other tablet.  For the price I paid we are not overly disappointed.  In short if you want to just browse or play games buy it.  If you want to take pictures and watch videos I'd look else where.  This is the first thing I've purchase through Amazon that I wasn't 100% happy with."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"Another brain-damaged design by Sony - a well-built, almost completely perfect device crippled to the point of being worthless by a small oversight.

This device starts tracks at the beginning after it powers off and you turn it back on.  This makes it a definite no-go for most people as it can't be used for long files such as audio books.

I contacted SonyStyle support before buying because the specs didn't indicate that it would resume tracks at the current point, and I wanted to know for sure before I bought it.  I have had a history of items from Sony that are like that - designed and tested by engineers, but completely untouched by non-techie consumers.  SonyStyle support assured me that it would resume tracks at the current point when powered off.  After buying and receiving the item, I couldn't find anything in the instructions about how to resume at current point, so I called SonyStyle again.  After 45 minutes of insisting that it would do it and attempting to do it on his, the tech finally admitted that it wouldn't.  It would only restart the current track.  He also couldn't give an ETA on a firmware update that would allow this.  So, (thanks Amazon), I sent it back. No more Sony for me.

It may be fixed at some point in the future by a firmware update, but caveat emptor.

For those that care, the players I found that do allow resume AND have PlaysForSure (no iPods here):

Creative Zen Stone (PERFECT device, awesome in every aspect)
Sandisk Sansa (AAA battery; when it dies you lose your place)
Samsung YPZ5 (cool but clunky, kind of expensive)

No PlaysForSure:
Rio (indestructible, so don't be afraid to buy a used one)
iPods (Shuffle has no visible display and is worthless, so avoid it)"
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"I have owned this camera for 4 years now.

Pros - Beautiful landscapes.
  Amazing outdoor shots and colors
  Easy to carry. Good response time. Good video too.
I have made a few trips, shot photos/videos at a couple of marriages and the comments on my landscape shots have generally been 'which camera do you have? Wooh that's costly for a non-SLR camera but the landscape shots are surely good.'

Cons- Indoor shots suck big time, flash power is too weak. I used a extra flash which had multiple levels but the light level indoors would either come too bright or weak and it would be just right only a few times.

I had bought it for around 600+ dollars(including the cost of accessories) when it had come out and was impressed by its build quality. It really looks cool and compact. But it turns out the prices of compactness is paid in the life of the camera. Since the lens retracts back and out it has a good chance of getting damaged. It looks like some sensors(battery/door/lens sensors) have got damaged.

That moving part stopped working a few weeks back. It does not start up and the repair cost will be at least half the cost of a good new camera. I have film cameras bought buy my dad's uncle at a yard sale in the 1950s that still work fine. I was expecting this camera to last me for at least 10 years. I am very disappointed that it has become unusable in 4 years.

I would have loved to give this camera at least 4 stars but wanted to give it only 1 for not being durable. Finally I am giving it 2 for at least good 4 years of service. They don't make them like they used to anymore. Will be trying a Nikon next."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"First off did not buy here, but BestBuy instead.

These speaker  looks very promising on paper - brand name, good looking speaker, THX certification (better than no certification?).
Unboxing - Boxes are heavily taped up.  Lots of Styrofoam separates separately from satellites.  One thing I noticed was lots of wires,  the right speaker is the control unit, so you have red/black lead, a control wire that connects to speaker, and phono plug that goes to computer.  The left speaker only has red/black lead.  The subwoofer connections are spring loaded.  Some stick on padded circle feet are included.

Setup - With all the wires going around, you will need to remove the plastic wrapping and undo the twist ties.  Be careful with the connections especially the red/black not to reverse them and don't force the control cable into the sub, as it can go in only one way.

Sound - Klipsch is known for room filling sound.  Not terrible, not great.  However, listening at low- normal volumes I had some weird static/cracking sound on the left speaker.  I said ok, a fluke, so exchanged it for another in store.  The second unit was better on the left channel, but it had popping/cracking (like popcorn) sounds when the subwoofer was activated.  I can't pinpoint what the cause was in both situations - is it amp, crossover, something loose in the speakers, who knows.  My PC does not have a problem with other speakers so I know the problem is with Klipsch

I spent more time unpacking, setup, and packing, rather than listening to speakers.

I hope you others don't have the same problem.  After returning the second unit, I went on the floor to see what they had out, and guess what the Promedia 2.1 they had on the floor had some static noises on left speaker too!

As such, I cannot recommend these"
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"Before purchasing I was a little leary, both of the bright room concerns voiced earlier and of buying from an Amazon associated company, not Amazon itself.  Purchasing a month ago, both fears were unfounded.

Electronic Express was fine, shipping on Monday after a Friday order via FedEx Ground.  The box was strapped vertically to a pallet and the driver helped removing it from the pallet and using a hydraulic platform to get it to the ground and into the house.  Net result:  no shipping nor delivery problems.  The set worked perfectly upon arrival.

As to the picture and operations, I have it on an HDMI connection from a DirecTV HD satellite connection.  The black level is as astonishing as they advertise and the picture as clean and crisp as I observed earlier (at a Sears where they had this, the Sharp and the Sony side-by-side, with the Samsung as good as the Sony and much better than the Sharp).

We are in Florida, where the sun is known to be particularly bright and this room has huge western sky facing windows.  There is a little sun glare and reflection in the very late afternoon but all parts of the screen are still easily viewable and after a few minutes any annoyance from glare and reflection is tuned out by one's eyes.  In sort, there's no problem here with the issue.

Highly recommended for the price and overall quality.

Addendum (December 2009):  Well, a month after the warranty expired, so did this product.  I had an authorized Samsung repair shop look at it and the LCD drivers had failed.  Great, I thought, a simple circuit board change.  WRONG!  That circuit board was ""married"" to the display so the entire display needed to be replaced.  $1500 plus labor!  Short result:  the Samsung was junked and a reliable Sony replacement purchased.  Star rating reflects the unconscionable cost of repair of a somewhat simple problem."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"Potentially good earphones with two major issues. I can rate them 2.5 to 3 stars based on the units I received.
First of all, the construction quality is really good. Buttons, earbuds, cables, eartips - everything is made of very good quality. The aluminium case is another pleasant bonus.
Speaking of sound quality, it's good but not great. I felt the bass is weak even after tweaking equalizer on my laptop as well as phone. Audio (especially music) feels little flat as compared to other earphones I tested. Having said that, it doesn't mean it's bad and is surely acceptable for daily use. The volume controls operate individually (independent of source volume) so that's a very good feature. Range is very good. I didn't notice audio breaking while walking away from source unless I went too far. As compared to other earphones I've tested, these have larger bluetooth range.
Two major issues these earphones have are battery life and in-ear fit. In-ear fit is not quite good. It keeps falling off the ears even after trying all eartips and earfins. I found mid-sized eartips better fitting than others. It's certainly manageable when you are doing a desk top and not moving around much. They fell off once when I was walking around in office. Battery life is the biggest disappointment. The earphones get fully charged in less than 2 hours (as is the case with most of other earphones) but I got ""battery level medium"" audio prompt within first half hour of use. I used then for another 40 minutes and I got ""battery low"" prompt and within few minutes they switched off as battery was completely off. So I could use them for less than 1.5 hours after fully charging them. I'm not sure if the battery issue is by design or if the units I received have this defect.
Conclusion - These earphones surely have potential but aforementioned two major issues disappoint you. If they at least had good battery life, they surely deserve 4.5 stars."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"I initially had high hopes for this product.  I have an HTPC with Windows Media Center that has built in Hauppauge tuners (one PCI single, 1500 series I think, and a dual PCIEx1 2250 model).  I was thinking that eventually, I'd be able to not be stuck with routing coax cables to the computer, and be able to access the tuner content over the network.  It worked pretty well for about 10 months.

The first one didn't work and after a hassle-free Amazon return, the second one broke after about 10 months.  The cooling fan stopped working and it was so hot to the touch, it was making my closet smell like burnt electronics.  I'm surprised it didn't catch on fire (not sure if it is UL listed or not.)  And like most warranties, you have to send it to the manufacturer and pay the shipping.  Yawn.  I guess I could have bought a new one and send the old one back, but that is somewhat unethical, and I didn't want to risk a house fire anyway, so at this point, I don't think you could pay me to take one.

The cooling fan in this unit is very loud, so it would need to be tucked away and not in the main viewing area.

On the other hand the Hauppauge tuners have performed flawlessly for probably about 5 years.  As a bonus, the Hauppauge also acts as my IR input to my computer which enables easy integration with Evenghost for automation with my Harmony remotes.  As a con, it seems the Hauppauge dual tuner has the worst signal, the single has slightly better, and the HDHomeRun had the best.  So if Hauppauge could better manage the ATSC signal in the tuner, there would be a clear winner there.  But even so, low heat, no noise, and flawless operation over 5 years is a large upside.

Bottom line, I will not purchase or consider this unit again."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"I had originally posted a pretty scathing review because of my dissatisfaction with this product. Kooltek promptly contacted me both by replaying here and by e-mail, and offered me a full refund and said that I could keep the cooler. I promised that if I kept it, I would try the product again on another computer I have that is an exact duplicate of the one I first installed it on.

I just got time to do that this weekend, so here is my revised review.

Pros - Cooler installs fairly easily with no modifications to the motherboard. Fan has a cool blue LED.

Cons - Performance is mediocre. I'm not sure it cools any better than my stock cooler, but it does so quieter since it uses a 120 mm fan running at less than half the speed of the small fan on the stock cooler.

I'm using this on an ASUS motherboard with an AM3+ socket. Unlike some coolers, I didn't have to chance the mount and backing plate to install this one. But the mount is cumbersome, requiring you to get fingers down into spots that can be tight to push down on the spring clips.

I wonder if the heat sink compound that came with the cooler is of good quality? I had terrible results with the first installation when I used it, but on the second installation I used some compound that I had purchased awhile back. It seems of better quality.

It does seem to be performing better than the first time, but not as well as I would have hoped. Another cooler I paid only $10 more for dramatically outperforms this one, though it is much harder to install, requiring removing and replacing the mount and backing plate.

I think this cooler needs further refinement to be a viable product. For now, I recommend paying $10 ore and going with a better product.

But kudos to Kooltek for standing behind their product and going the extra mile to make me happy. That went a long way with me."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"I wanted to revitalize my early 2011 MacBook Pro.  The drive itself works mostly as expected (about 12% slower than its specs).  But the installation was arduous and can be expensive.

First, the drive is formatted for Windows and all the software provided is Windows only.  So you need to use Disk Manager to erase the disk, rename it to something meaningful, and reformat it to Mac OS Extended Journaled.  Then you need a piece of software like Carbon Copy Cloner to mirror your existing hard disk onto the new SSD.  CCC is a great software package, which you should probably own anyway for various backup tasks, but if you don't already have it, buying it adds to the expense of the upgrade.

The provided installation guide is a pamphlet of 8 pictures for installing on a desktop, 6 pictures for installing on a laptop, and 1 frame of cautions.  All very generic and useless for my MacBook Pro.  By the way, both sets of pictures show a SATA-to-USB adapter cable for cloning, which was not included and must be purchased separately.

The installation requires a 7mm to 9.5mm space adapter for 2.5 drives.  Again this is an additional purchase as the Samsung SSD is more shallow than the original drive.  The actual physical installation involves removing the cover, removing the drive clamp and old drive, removing the 4 stud screws on the old drive and putting them onto the SSD, applying the spacer (be sure to orient the drive to the cable connector before adhering it), seating the drive (it still seemed a little loose), re-installing the drive clamp and replacing the cover.  The studs are required on the new drive to make sure it seats into the clamp.  Why Samsung couldn't spend an extra $.0005 and include these on the SSD is unknown.

So, overall 4 stars for the drive, 0 stars for the lack of Mac installation support and the required accessory expenses, averaging out to 2 stars for this review."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"I had a sony P-200 camera 7.2mp to replace it with the Canon. My friend bought a Canon G-7 to replace the Sony (We have the Same Sony Camera). We both got in to the hype of all the reviews. We both tested the canon cameras quite a bit. Both Canon(s) has more options then the Sony does. But the Sony overall picture is much sharper and the colors are more realistic and natural. I kept my Canon just cause I was in so deep, I had already received a 8 gig SDHC Card, had a rebate on the Epson Printer so I ended up keeping the Canon and sold the Sony. It was a hard choice, knowing the sony picture quality is that much better. My friend on the other hand is selling his New Canon G-7, ""too bulky and its not worth it to lug it around when the Sony P-200 takes better sharper pics."" I agree, the Sony picture quality is better then the Canon 850IS. I can affirm that! The only thing is the Sony takes average low light pics, but the Canon 850is is no world beater in that department either. When it comes to day light shots, the Sony wins hands down over the 850is and also according to my friend the sony beats the Canon G-7 in outdoor photos ""not zoomed"". Like I said the Canon(s) has more options, and some might counter that you need to manaual play with the canon to get a better pic. But really who wants to mess with manual settings on a trip overseas? How many pics will you miss? The Sony P-200 has as fast boot up as the Canon 850IS and takes pics much much faster with the flash when it comes to multiple pics. And the sony flat out takes better pics. No doubt the canon is a excellent camera, but its questionable as to how good compared with a sony that came out in 2005...the Sony has less options, but has great image quality and ""sony Style""."
Electronics_5,negative,truthful,"I was one of the first to purchase Trakdots when they initially came out, then quickly learned (a) there is virtually no user support, and (b) the software was horribly flawed. Since then, the company has paid buyers to ship the units back for a ""major software update,"" but...getting my two units back has been a nightmare.

I shipped them to the vendor, as directed, in early November, yet here I am in late January, STILL trying to get my supposedly-updated TrakDots back. Endless emails back and forth, lots of ""We'll overnight them right away"" promises, but nothing.

If it was possible to give negative stars on a review, I would. TrakDots are a complete waste of money.

* * * * * 01.30.14 FOLLOW UP * * * * *

Finally got two units back. Notice I didn't say ""my units."" In spite of assurances we'd be getting our originals back, I was sent two open box returns that someone else dumped. The security seals on both boxes were torn open; the serial number on one unit had been completely removed (rendering it incapable of being activated) with the ""Warranty void if damaged"" seal torn in half.

One of my two originals had yet to be activated (read: brand new, unused). Now, I'm holding someone else's rejects.

* * * * * 02.11.14 FOLLOW UP * * * * *

After circling back to TrakDot *again,* was sent two more replacement units. These did not appear to have been opened, however...neither one would power on. Tried multiple batteries, to no avail. Both units were dead boxes.

This time, I cc'd (Harry Streck, President of GlobaTrac) on my email to Customer Service, asking for a full refund of my entire purchase price, including the pre-paid first year of service for each unit. Getting Mr. Streck involved made the difference--while Customer Service continued to try a ""Let's talk first"" approach, he apologized for the problems, and issued a full refund, call-tagging the four faulty replacement units.

Trakdot is, without question, the worst purchase decision I've ever made, but at least I got my money back. Finally."

Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,Not the best movie we've ever seen. Wish I wouldn't have purchased it and instead rented it. It's a one time watch of a movie.
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"OK show,  lead singer voice is past it's prime but worth watching. Aduio and picture are pretty good and the set list is good."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"This reminds me of a 1960's, low budget horror flick. If you don't have any other thing to do, it's ok and well that's about it."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,We found a cut place on one of the dvd watching it . It totally stop working. A one star rating they don't deserve even that.
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"My husband liked it, but I was bored. It didn't really hold my interest. I also felt like the ending could have been wrapped up better."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"I am glad I watched it - it was good, clean fun.  Shows that movies CAN be made without bad language and still be good!"
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"We had high expectations considering the good reviews, but unfortunately very boring, limited plot, poor acting. Had to turn it off. Silly, just didn't make sense."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,I didn't really care for the movie would not watch again. [ bought because of the reviews. I like true stories. maybe it wasn't my taste
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"Unusal behavior, this was a true story.  I never could understand what this fellow thought he was protecting.  I would not watch this again."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"Godawful, don't waste your time!! Gave it one star because there are no -1.
Purchased at Red Box for a buck twenty eight and would like a refund."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"I just got this and I already sold it at my garage sale, lol. It's not bad, it just could have and should have been much better."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,this is not the worst zombie movie some good makeup but not so good cgi if u have nothing to do or with some friends getting drunk
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"I think Flashpoint is one of my favirit shows, i was glad to find it. But it kept cutting out. I hope they fix  that soon."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,Pretty much exactly what the title says.  Not really great on fight scene choreography.  Mostly just running from and trying to duck the flying guillotines.
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,Lots of wonderful scenic footage of the Maine coast lines from south to north. Wish there was more narrative on the towns and regions that were covered.
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"I don't know what to tell you. this one I just am not sure about. I am of the fence didn't hate it, but didn't love it."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,It was slow and I did not feel like it tied things up well. I was very surprised because each actress is wonderful in their own right.
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,I liked the idea that a Bruja may live next door.  The characters made you like them so much that it made the next events more horrifying.
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"Was disappointed; found it boring.  But then I've become addicted to Breaking Bad, fast action/violence/suspense,
so this might have spoiled me for John Adams more slow plot development."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"If you like chick flicks, you'll like this one.  It's not anything fabulously wonderful to write about, but it's a good movie on a rainy, boring day!"
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"A very interesting movie.
The main problem I had was the musical score blaring over the dialogue. At times it was impossible to understand what the actors were saying."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,This Heath Ledger film isn't supposed to be an historic epic. Rather a light spoof of the historic movie. Entertaining and I always like to watch the late Ledger.
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,Sorry action fans but this one is a dud.. Confusing in its never ending attempt to have action scenes. they were just jumbled together until they reached 90 minutes.
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,Enjoyed the Venetian scenery.  The movie was eerie and has a rather shocking ending.  It was great to see Sutherland and Christie  in their hey day.
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"This is a film I was expecting to love, but unfortunately it couldn't hold my interest. The story seemed weak and dragged on. Someone else might really enjoy it."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"This movie made me hate this character. What a terrible sequel, with gawdawful writing. I seriously despise Liam's psychotic character now, who was so wonderful in the first film."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"I have NO CLUE what happened the last 10 minutes of this movie.  And the POINT was???
What a let down.
BTW, -- the other ONE-STAR reviews?  Believe them!"
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"The first Kick-Ass movie was OK-to-Good. This sequel was simply awful, in so man ways. I couldn't even get through 45 minutes of it. Total waste of time and money."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"Delivery Man... cute idea, ok script, still yet another Vince Vaughn movie,  If you like his acting is worth watching ONCE...  Predictable Hollywood box office hail mary pass"
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"Was looking forward to a GOOD period movie.  Boy oh boy...WHAT A LET DOWN.... Don't waste your money on this one.  It's story is absolute ridiculous and base,"
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,How could the producers of this video show an abandon rabbit on the boat and dogs in a pen chained with no one in attendance? Is that not animal cruelty!
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"If you are into teen age angst you will like this. Otherwise, not so much.  I fell in love with summer wars but was really disappointed on this one"
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"Dullest movie I have seen to date. If you need something to run in the background but not watch, it would be ok, but as a movie, it is a joke."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,Not presented in any interesting way. I unfortunately did not finish it yet. Definitely presented some interesting facts about our food and how corn is used in nearly everything we eat.
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"I watched this movie because Tommy Lee stared and it was filmed in southwest Louisiana.  The movie was just OK.  Acting was fairly good, story line was a step below."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"One would think super hot college girls would be enough to keep me watching a show, no matter how bad.  I could only watch 13 minutes; should have quit after 3."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,Action packed but not even close to reality having been to the White House there is no way you just carry stuff in there no matter what you are doing with it.
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,this is a very boring film and very predictable.this film was done a year before this one came out.this film is The White Waiting To Exhale.pure formula.you'd swear Puff Daddy was the director?
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"glad the movies still are out so my girls can watch them. like i did as a younger girl. the movie was here fast or on time, nicely packaged. played well."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"This is not the same Denziel Washington Safe House. The Denzial Washington Safe House was a really exciting film. This one was mediocre, although there wasn't really anything wrong with it technical wise."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"This is an excellent movie.  However, the constant fat shaming for comedy truly makes me cringe these days.  Even so, this is a fun movie to watch, most of the time."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"I liked the show and thought it was rather funny.  Some parts were a little far out, but on a whole it was a fun watch.  I would say WATCH IT."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"Fun to watch but a mess. Jessica is good, as usual, but Joan and Kathy are TV movie-ish. Wish Jessica hadn't just had a face lift though... her oddly pulled face put me off."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,this is a movie that if you are a whiney self involed queen will think is tacky ad if you  like cheesy then watch it if not run away now not worht it
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"Had to shut this one off about 20 mins in.  Thank goodness our Society is more vocal about not tolerating teacher's inappropriate behavior to the minor-aged student.  It's not funny, it's a crime."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"Only five minutes into this play and I had to turn it off.  I can't stand how Tyler keeps putting the ratchet, ghetto scenes in his plays.  There is no need for over-acting."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,I really wanted to see this.  The first one is one of my favorites.  But it just was not as good.  I dunno.  Can't give you much more without spoiling the movie.
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"A little disappointed.  It's quite a typical love story and nothing out of the ordinary for Kate Hudson.  I'm still looking for that spark she first had.
I think I'll donate this one to charity."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,It was a pretty good flick but not as good as the original.  Hit Girl has grown up a bit as has Kick Ass and I think they were better characters when they were younger.
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"It's so bad that I merely FF through it. Dakota is laughable, and idk wth is with the guy cast as Christian. Had this been Alexander Skaarsgard and Mila Kunis we would've had one great film."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"It goes with the soundtrack CD I purchased. Didn't care for it and probably won't ever watch it again. Predictable, not a great transfer to DVD. Tried to enjoy it, surprised Anthony Quinn took the part."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"This has a different look at the situation.  As the military is all volunteer, far fewer young men are faced with this contradiction of hour philosophy.  I cannot understand the country's thrill for military conflicts."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"The performances were fine, but stunted. A lot was cut out of the story. After seeing the version with Tom Hardy it is impossible to see Heathcliff as anyone else. That version was incredible. This is, eh."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"perhaps i need some camera movement - there was none
i watched this movie because i heard it was a visual feast. the colors were all washed out as if this was a digital version of a VHS tape."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,I thought this DVD slightly below an average National Geographic video once there is more personal dramas than scienfic information. However I was moved by the story of a teacher with a brain tumor and his family anxiety.
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"Like many other reviews, i grow with the old Smurfs cartoons, and i think the first The Smurfs is really good, and entertaining for adults too....This one is just too much....Too much Smurfs for sure.....Stick with the first one!!!!!!"
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"I thought this would be a good action film, it was a good B rated action film that you could sleep through.  The first 20 min, there was more violence than I care to see....too much blood and gore."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"An illogical horror film about a demoniac trapped in a mirror. The only way to destroy it is to let it re-posses a Catholic nun. When the hero does so, he turns into a mirror image of himself. Or something."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,Great moments.  Breathtaking Cinematography.  Deviates from historical accuracy about 2/3 of the way through in the cause of storytelling which I can forgive but the story was... average.  (Spoiler). Grizzly bear attack was awesome.  Some explicitness (rape).
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"I love when the 'scientist' says, ""Time travel comes down this: either we are standing still and time is moving, or time is standing still, and we are moving. Either way ... .""

What? Time standing still and we are moving? Hilarious."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"Ok, I'm putting I don't like it because I watched it 2 weeks ago and I've already forgotten everything about it. So I must not have liked it. I only know it was in sub-titles. Can't remember a single other thing."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,11 discs in set only 1 disc played on my high end BD player...  Firmware was up to date; no joy.  Apparently the manufacturing standards for discs AND players have been changed without informing most of the paying customers...
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"A cute film, although entirely predictable. At least it wasn't about an action here from a comic book. Or the least effective monster, the zombie. Or maybe it would have been less predictable if zombies had been included. We'll never know."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"Spoiler alert.  Michelle saves herself from her suddenly animated house by shooting it with a shotgun.  And thats as good as this one got.  Well cast, well directed, great costumes...but nothing can overcome a mediocre script.  Sigh."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,This movie was so stupid. The only good thing about this movie was Stuart Townsend but even he couldn't save this movie from getting more than one star from me. What were they thinking when they released this pile of trash?!
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,It is a documentary.  Interesting if you are a WWII buff.  It is amazing that he was able to escape trial and punishment for his war crimes.  With today's information systems and technology he would not have gotten away.
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,Harder to follow than the book. You start in the middle of the story with no idea as to what is going on unless you read the book which was very pedestrian. Neither the book nor the movie is worth your time.
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"I ordered this product and was charged for it, but never received it. Apparently it wasn't in stock after all. I'm a little sad that I don't own it, but the seller promptly made good on their mistake and fully refunded the order."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"I was intrigued by this, having seen a part of an episode on tv. It starts off great, interesting characters, good plot but then becomes silly and the end of Series One is so ridiculous that I threw the box in the garbage!"
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"I really wanted to like this show because I know that Louis CK is respected as a comic genius. But despite a few funny moments, I didn't care for it. It is too crude and gross for my taste. To each her own."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,This is a couch doctor who majors in quizzical looks and doesn't accept anything on face value.  Each episode is a stand-alone doctor/patient exchange without diagnosis or treatment.  I just don't have the endurance to see if he really ever treats successfully.
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,This 3rd film in the Hobbit saga is again a bit long and too full of action to bring emotions to the table as some scenes seem more like a video game and Peter Jackson seems to be playing more than making a movie.
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,My high hopes were not achieved.  My feeling is even the mediocre reviews are overstated.  The movie is simply way to slow.  Virtually no action adventure going on.  I had envisioned something like the Three Kings movie.....not even remotely close.
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,Bought this movie on a whim because a friend was always talking about how great it is. I had it on for MAYBE 30 minutes and shut it off.  I've never put it in my DVD player again.  I just wasn't into it!
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"Great movie... years ago I bought the DVD of these movies, they had 5.1 sound. I bought this for the 1080p quality but these are only 2 channel... What happened...? I would not buy this if you are like me and want the HD experience..."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"For having some generally good actors in it, I must say that the script and acting of the movie are probably the worst I have ever seen... But on a good note the shipping was fast and Amazon's service is great.  Just a terrible flick."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"I enjoy this movie, and decided to get the blu ray instead of the criterion edition. This was a horrible mistake. The blu ray has no special features, not even a commentary(the criterion has 3). I will be purchasing the criterion edition sometime in the future."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,There was so much going on it was very difficult to follow.  The language by the characters was very offensive - every sentence contained a vulgar language.  Not a series I would recommend.  We stopped play about 20 minutes into the first episode.
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"Trash, but trash with a certain pedigree. Ordinarily Stuart Whitman should not be compared with the can't take your eyes off them greats and there's nothing here to make you think otherwise, but in spite of it all it does possess a certain something...Janet Leigh? Maybe."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"I hate to see the rating on this film misrepresented so I have to rate it.  Aside from the lousy picture and sound, the movie stinks.  Hard to believe both John Sturges and Charles Bronson were involved in this schlup, if that's even a word..."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"It was merely okay. Too many unanswered questions, lengthy stretches without any meaningful  action. You never know why he was sailing alone for one thing. I watched all the way through thinking something meaningful was going to pop up but it never showed. Compelling but incomplete."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"1, 2, & 3 were far better.
The thing is that ""Hunter"" is introduced here but to the little boy, as a neighbour.
The scenes do keep you at the edge of your seat, nail-biting scenes, causes goosebumps - but it was not as gripping as the first 3!"
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,Not at all satisfied with this DVD.  Especially the sound.  Just not at all clear and fades out in some scenes. Picture not the best in fact I have seen better.  Don't recommend this unless you are a collector.  Better DVDs out there.
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"I need to select different scenes to show; for a college class that I teach- I was STUNNED to discover neither of these discs HAS a menu! I'm really upset. I have to see if I can return them, as they are NOT gonna work for me."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"Boy shags strainge woman in the woods, and starts to change into a female everytime he gets excited. meets beautiful girl who also turns into a boy, they take turns. Only good thing about this stupid movie is that the boys are cute. Don't waist your time."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"i don't know what they were thinking when they edited this soap opera. they shopped it up in a way that interferes with the story and the sequence of events. things happen sometimes, and you find out later why they happen in terms of the story line."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"If you like hallmark made-for-tv movies, then this is for you. If you hate hallmark with a run-like-a-zombie passion, avoid this. This is a film about the emotional aspect of having to outlived the dead by somekind of plague. VERY EMOTIONAL but not a tear jerker. Just average."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"As of Jul/9/2009, The Legend of Billie Jean has unfortunatly not been released on dvd. Dvd listings for new and used copies are bootlegs. If you are very desperate for a copy, order at your own risk. This ""import"" was not a legit version else where."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,Absurd plot loaded with unbelievable coincidences but numerous humorous moments. Hard to know if the director was trying to make a crime drama or a comic  movie about criminals involving a bundle of stock characters. When will they ever learn about the stupidity of the sideways-held handgun?
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,Hated the story line. It was basically a string of cameo opportunities for Bollywood stars to show up. It tried to mix a serious story with too much light humor. Then it was scary. This movie couldn't make up its mind what genre it was. Don't waste your time.
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"the story just didn't capture me. the plot feels .... lacking. it's not a movie I'd watch over again.
the biggest issue is that I feel there are no chemistry between the main characters and for a romantic film. geez. no wonder why they have a lot of mix reviews."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"Totally retarded, ""I've got amnesia, people are out to kill me, who am I and how can I stop this insidious plot that I'm starting to unravel"" type of a film. Incorporates elements of the Bourne trilogy, Memento, Salt, some of those stupid Tom Cruise movies, etc. Dumb dumb dumb."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,Be warned...I can only review this on the first 30 minutes and then I had to turn it off. Horrifyingly slow and boring. The lead actor who lives in his car? Devin Ratray?  Why????? Watching grass grow had more life. I just couldn't waste anymore of my life on this.
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"This movie is mean, man ...!!! It was clearly made with the best of intentions: a history about a Secret Society and a young man ( Jackson in his worst performance ever ) trying to get out of it. But the execution of the screenplay is so bad that all is lost..."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"Tried to watch this right after The Gathering Storm, turned it off about 20 minutes in. Brendan Gleeson's mumbling was too much to make the movie enjoyable. If Albert Finney could be understood with a cigar in his mouth, can't understand Mr Gleeson's failure with nothing in his. He tried to hard."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"WOW, WOW, WOW.  I Tried to give it half a star but was unable to.  The cinematography was cheesy as well as the acting.  Wow really bad.  I couldn't get past how poorly made this was to finish watching it.  Too bad......the cover showed so much promise."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"This movie is a tear jerker. It is about two young people who find each other and fall in love. They fall into forbidden love. It has a sad ending so if you are a happy ending person, perhaps this isn't for you. The acting is pretty good, but not the best."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"I was surprised that is was I Chinese with English Dubbed.  I was glad it had the English option but was expecting an English Version.
The story line was so far different than the Disney Version and very Bloody.  Not suitable for children. A little too violent for me and my wife."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,I saw this movie in the theatres limited run for Academy qualifications.  Expected much for disappointed as I could not get an emotional attachment when emotion was vital to the storyline.  Also it's hard for non-Japanese to understand the ghost world myths so that may have something to do with it.
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"OK, Oscar material this isn't.  But hey, it's a talking dog movie what are you expecting, De Niro?  The plot is tissue paper thin and the acting is cheesy, but it is a talking dog movie.  My 95 yo mother thinks the idea of talking animal is hilarious, so good stuff."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"I never saw the movie as it never opened at a nearby neighborhood theater.  I bought the dvd as a result of my curiosity.  I thought it was well done with Anthony Hopkins playing the title role.  In parts it was slow moving, but the drama of making ""Psycho"" was
overall okay"
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,They have a lot to recover from with all the deaths of young people in previous seasons especially Matthew. The next couple who gets pregnant on that show should get very nervous given the odds of survival for one of them based on past story lines!! Need some lasting good news for a couple.
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"Liam plays a character whose undercover cop career has reached the point of turning him into a mental wreck with serious gastrointestinal issues.  The story stinks, the acting is mostly marginal (Sandra Bullock is good as always, but is a small role here) and this was simply just a total waste of time."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"Mostly, this well-produced film is distinguished by a muted, naturalistic tone and good acting backing a logical script. But there's neither drama or action to recommend. It's just a unique
view of a rather mundane aspect of a samurai's domestic life. In another context, it might be
a soap-opera rendition of Samurai family life, traumas and all."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,This isn't a horror movie. It's a Gothic romance. I went into this movie with low expectations and ended up enjoying it for the most part. The plot isn't anything new and the story is predictable. I did wish they had fleshed out Thomas' character more. Without spoiling I didn't really get why he loved Edith.
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,This is an interesting though flawed revisionist take on the on-going battle between angels and demons. Add in a further fictionalized Frankenstein monster (aka Adam) to the mix and the result is a rip-roaring actionfest with some strains of prophecy and fantasy. It is not bad for what it is - a feast fro the senses.
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,Poor video quality and the sound was inaudible a lot of the time.  I realize these are extremely old shows put onto disc but the overall quality was extremely poor.  I gave them as a gift and was rather embarassed when I was told about how bad they were. Would definitely NOT recommend this item.
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"This movie was a complete waste of $2.
I knew after 3 seconds that it was going to be lame.
I take chances on indie flicks here & there because sometimes they work out well.
I fast forwarded into several parts of the movie and it was all unentertaining.
Yes, I know it had a low budget, it sucked either way.
Next."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"The start of the movie was--well--predictable.  The rest of it was poorly-conceived, at times inconceivable,  poorly-directed, and mostly unbelievable:  especially the ending, which was completely unnecessary.  I hope this was one of Caviezel' s earliest:  his subsequent portrayal of Jesus was superbly acted, directed and memorable-- plus his more recent movies and television."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"The actress was in her 20s playing a teenager. Fine. Maybe if I'd never seen her performance in the TV show ""Lost"", I wouldn't have cringed at her ""performance"" in this movie. She was fine in that role as a 20-something.
Here, she WAY overdid the gawky excitable-apple-of-daddy's-eye. She's the reason I won't see the sequel. Glad everybody got paid..."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"I think there's something to be said about worshipping honor and idolizing the relationship (he subjects himself to a homosexual) with someone who isn't God, (Claire) since Jamie is supposed to be somewhat religious as a Scotsman. I'm pretty ashamed I even watched this in part justifying the love scenes of J&C. Hoping people write and produce better stuff"
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"Typical AI science fiction with the robot deciding to do its own thing.  How these sorts of films get financing, other than for tax dodges, is a mystery.  There have been so many artificial intelligence run amok films made to date that it's difficult to formulate a new story line.  Move on . . . nothing interesting here."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"Decent movie and it kept me watching to know what happened at the end, I will say I wanted it to be a little better but it was good and worth a watch.  I did see it on best movies of the year on some lists and I don't know about that but it was good for a low budget movie."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,Not even Nathan Lane can lift this otherwise mediocre film out of ordinariness. The chemistry between Sorvino and Kilmer is just not believable no matter how many sculptures she finishes. I would have no  problem in seeing Val in a villainous role however. This is one for the  disability of the week sunday night tv movie. It just didn't gel...
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"If you like period plays then rent this film, the acting is superb.  If you aren't the theatre type then you should steer clear.  It is not what you would expect of a film starring Colin Farrell and Jessica Chastain unless you're expecting a stage play written for film.  I think the other reviews speak enough to the actual storyline."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,Being a Star Trek fan I approached this Finnish homage to the franchise with some trepidation.  Apart from the costumes there was really no attempt to emulate the moral fortitude of our well known heroes such as Spock and Captain Kirk.  In this version morality flew out of the window.  That said I will concede that the special effects were outstanding.
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"I am 1 hr 44 mins into this film and had been continuously bored by this complete mess of a big budgeted war film.
Spike Lee should have done better homework before he launched his attempt to recount black soldiers heroics
during WWII.  At lease he could have cut 40 mins out of this 160 mins film.  For more details, refer to the other
negative reviews."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"Especially for fans of ""Romeo and Juliet"" this film has much to offer. The changes in the story are interesting. Much of the acting is good, especially from the lovers. It is a spectacular film to watch. The biggest disappointment is the songs. They are not particularly exciting to hear or see. When the songs are dull in a Bollywood film, the film really suffers."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"This movie did everything it could to compensate for not having even a halfway decent script. So with an attempt to dazzle with detail and glitter, it ultimately leads to the all-too-familiar growing and ragging beast who has (once again) sucked its energy from the city power supply and (once again) only becomes more powerful when it's attacked. I couldn't believe I was watching this garbage again."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"Okay, seriously now...how many of you watched this and all the while kept hearing (or making) Joel, Mike and 'Bot riffs? This would have been prime fodder for the Misties, make no mistke. By itself, though, it admittedly doesn't stand out much, other than being one of the few terrible sci-fi movies from that era that I somehow managed to miss. I'm not weeping over the loss."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"Destry was a good show,unfortunately it didn't last long. I think it was on for half of a season. Timeless Media has done a masterful job on remastering on shows alot older than this show, the results were a bit lacking on this project. The last episode was best as far as clarity is concerned. Other than that I am happy to have it in my collection."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"I am a fan of Little Shop and purchased this DVD as a period piece. Viewers looking for Nicholson to star or even ""act"" in this DVD version will be very disappointed. He plays a minor role and his acting is no better than others in the cast (which is pretty disappointing). Perhaps I have missed something, but this DVD is not worth the price of admission."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"The first third to a half of the movie was slow, repetitive (part of the story line but it was basically boring), and not engaging, but I kept watching it  based on the 4.5 stars online review.  The last third was better and it had a decent ending. But I would not watch it again as it was just to boring to get to that point."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"I think someone with a home movie camera and 5 min of practicing the lines could do as well as this movie. My g*** its bad, real bad.
btw way I only watched 5 min before I couldn't stand the stupidly and fakeness of it all.

ok you gave me a 2nd chance to edit again. It's ever thing as bad as I thought it was. DO NOT ever watch this!"
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"Despite their hit-and-miss filmography, the Coen Brothers never could be accused of making a bad movie. Then along came ""Hail, Caesar!""  a star-studded ""satire"" of 1950s Hollywood filled with misfired in-jokes and unrelenting tedium. In other words, ""The Big Lebowski"" without the laughs. Stunning period detail fails to camouflage a shockingly weak Coen script. Josh Brolin's inspired performance as studio fixer Eddie Mannix deserves a much better film."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,purchase movie to play on my samsung web based 3d blu ray player only to find out about samsungs incompatibility with a lot of blu ray titles. but that was not the movies fault. still i watched on ps3 in 3d and wasn't  totally impressed. it's a decent movie and the 3d in sokay. not as good as some movies but i am still glad to make  the puchase.
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"I was so excited to watch this because of M. Night Shyamalan - boy, what a huge letdown.  I could have handled the rather slow uneventful movie if there had been a creative twist at the end like other movies by Shyamalan. But no, I saw the ending coming half way through the movie. Don't waste your money on this movie - wait til you can watch it for free."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"I like the yoga sequences in this DVD I find them chanllanging, and invigorating. However, the first 2 sequences ""energize"" and ""tone"" are very similar, ""tone"" just inlcudes a little more standing balance exercies. I like the the third sequence the best, ""sweat"", which inclues partial headstand and arm balance exercies.

The one thing I don't like about this DVD is the music. It sounds like music from a bad 80s action movie."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"Not what I expected, A very boring movie in my opinion, I like Gregory Peck but this movie just not do it for me . Very slow from the start and cheap animation and poor production value with mediocre acting and boring story . I just did not care for the actors in the film or the production of this film it was a waste of money buying the DVD Blu-ray ."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"It is beyond me how this got so many good reviews.  If you like porn you will not like this.  If you do not like porn you will not like this.  There is no magic between any of the actors.  Wait, they aren't actors, they're all lousy.  The story line is full of contradictions.  Nothing works!  I wish I had read the bad reviews before ever purchasing this."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"This was almost unwatchable.  My question?  Did Jeremy Renner need the money?
I really don't have much else to say about this movie.  There were 2 times the F word was used and for no real reason.  It was rather a gratuitous use of the word.  J. Renner said it once and it was seemed so ridiculous.  The names Hansel and Gretel also seemed ridiculous as well in this movie."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"Its not near as bad as reviews suggest--the novelty and 3D alone are worth the time and as good as most hollywood trash. Yes you need a multstd 3d blueray player like the Orei (worth doing as there are lots of foreign releases, (especially in 3D) that will likely never be released in USA),  or play it on a pc by changing your region code for one play or of course rip the file."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"I don't understand what is so great about this movie. It's a good action flick, but not the best or most exciting.
The opening scene was really good, but after that the movie got dull. If it weren't for Heath Ledger's performance, I would have not bothered watching at all. Everyone else, except for Eric Roberts who was pretty cool in his small part, was boring as heck.
""Iron Man"" is a much better super hero movie."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"Ok the actors are good but I expected something else. In this movie, the German soldiers and officers are just too kind ! I don't think that finally the whole story is believable. Don't expect the usual War movie with this one,You will finish in a court room mostly ! It's full of moral,justice,pride,honour...seen in far better acts before To end,this movie could have lasted 1:30 instead of the 2 LOOOOOOONNNNNNGGGGGG hours : an eternity !"

Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"A rumor was spread that this movie was made of real footage found out side a forest! This made me live the THRILL and SHOCKING SUSPENSE..!
After removing the reality from the story and knowing that it was fiction... the movie turned into a cheap budget myth!
If only the rumor was real, this would have been something very powerful, very emotional, very thrilling, but now..!
To enjoy it, live the experience as if it was made of genuine footage!"
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"it arrive today. I opened it and the disc literally dropped out. it was not secured properly. it had smudges, finger-prints all over it and scratches.
it took me a few  minutes to try to clean all the crap that was on it to no avail.
luckily it played with no problem. but, it was as if a 5 yr. old kid had played with it, then dropped into the case.
don't think ill ever buy from this business again"
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"Based on a novel by the team of Nordhoff and Hall, this dreary film was an obvious attempt to duplicate the success of MUTINY ON THE BOUNTY, also based on a novel by the same duo.  Since, like its predecessor, it involves a long sea voyage with a sadistic captain, it can't miss, right?  Unfortunately, the resulting film is very dull and is only partly redeemed by good performances, but even James Mason cannot quite save it."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"Ridiculous. As a U.S. American I am not too proud to admit that we have become the BIGGEST threat to the entire world with a reputation for invading and destroying more countries than any other country on the planet. Iran has resources, Syria is in the way to Iran, go figure. Its Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Vietnam all over again. But you have to ask yourself... why are there never ""terrorist"" attacks in Saudi Arabia or Israel? Hmmm.. I wonder... NOT."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"American Hustle managed to receive so much critical acclaim and Academy Award attention purely on the pedigree of its star powered cast and talented director. Otherwise, this is merely a nostalgic rehash of other, better movies, but, that isn't to say it's completely lifeless. Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper give great performances and this movie can be quite funny at times. So, while this movie isn't a waste of time, it's nothing to go out of your way for either."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"My preschooler loves Laurie Berkner's music and the videos on Noggin and Jack's Big Music Show are great. But the videos on this collection are really boring. Just the three in the band with occasional kids here and there--very boring sets, etc. I'd recommend skipping the video and just buying the music cd (this one also came with a music cd, so that is a nice bonus). If you want fun videos, buy a DVD collection of Jacks' Big Music Show."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,I was never so bored with this dribble. The only thing I got a kick out of is seeing William Defoe's character's insane wife drill a hole in his leg and put some kind of bolted grind stone bolted to it. He dragged him self around like a goon. I got a little tired of penis shots in the movie. The first part of the movie I thought I was watching a porn or something. iIn a nutshell WEIRD and BORING.
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"Released in 1969. Everyone who had anything to do with this film is now either deceased or long out of the movie business. Who got paid for digging ""The Witchmaker"" out of the landfill almost fifty years later?  Is there a living to be made exhuming mediocrity when there's so much fresh mediocrity still above ground?  I suppose images depicting the degradation, abuse, or slaughter of young women will always appeal to enough people to make supplying them a viable business."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"I generally enjoy ""bad"" movies, but there weren't too many entertaining elements to this one.
The way it was shot, I was willing to let go of considering its budget.  The ""acting"" was not the worst I've seen (and can make B films diverting at times) ... it was consistently poor, though, and I couldn't find much redeeming value.  About half an hour into the film, where it made some attempt at becoming exciting, I just had to give up and move on."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"We have been offshore sailors for many years.  We could not even finish watching this movie that was obviously written by, directed by, and acted by non-sailors.  Our frustration came from watching a completely ill prepared bumbling fool try to deal with critical emergencies in slow motion.  After the initial problem the rest of the troubles were created by the character through mistakes and inaction.  Because he even played this role I have lost a little more respect for Robert Redford."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"We rented this movie last Saturday night and could not watch the whole thing!  It was that bad!!  The plot line is so convoluted we all (4 of us) had trouble following it!  Usually, when I rent a movie that isn't very good I'll watch it again to see what I missed, but I couldn't do it with this one.  The acting is the only thing good about it and even that couldn't save this horrible story line!  Save your money!"
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"If you like silly, then this is your flick. I would not say it was all bad. I certainly did laugh out lout a few times. I do like Vince Vaughn even though if you watch one of his movies then you know his character, he is always the same. I noticed he wrote, produced and directed this movie. More power to him for choosing this visually stunning location to have his movie made. This film in blu ray does make you feel you are there."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"Its a Bank Robbery Story with a few mild plot twists. Its ok but nothing to write home about. Again, you do not need to buy this video. I would rate it a C+ at best a B. Nudity: only one shower scene with a few butts. No Sex. And in case you were wondering, it is not a Gay move. Well acted but the plot is uninteresting and the little secret that you discover at the end is truly very, very, very little. Ho Hum."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"The Mummy is a good example of a mediocre movie that is made interesting by the director's commentary on the DVD version.  In some ways the fact that it is not a very good movie makes the director's comments even more  fascinating, as we get explanations for what they were trying to do, and  some intriguing insights into the mind of a second-rate director.  Might be  worth buying if the DVD starts to disappear from rental shelves, which  eventually will happen."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"This movie is an outstanding example of what digital technology can achieve visually. For this, it deserves 2 stars.
What a pity, however, that so much tecnical effort distracted the makers and made them forget the importance of a good plot.
This is truly a lost opportunity, an anti-statement in sci-fi.
Maybe next time the combination of this tecnicians with the ideas provided in the stories of people like Bradbury, Henlein, Asimov, will achieve the final fantasy: a digital masterpiece that will score as Blade Runner did in its time........"
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"this is  the worst show I have seen the actors and the script is unreal seems like  she works part time as  SGT picking her grandson up from school  runs after a ice cream truck  kicks in a door with no back up behind her and seems to break down every time she remembers an incident
and thats only the on the first disk would not recomend  this  just waste of time and money going to give this a rating of ZERO"
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"As a big fan of the early James Bond, I have tried to continue to enjoy the series of movies that followed the Sean Connery reign as Bond. These latter day movies with actors other than Connery (exception, Roger Moore) are just not satisfying to the older Bond fan. Judi Dench makes a very good ""M"" and Daniel Craig is almost believable as Bond. The story line is engaging. Waste your time on it if you cannot find any other movie that jumps out at you (to watch)."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"Kristen Stewart did a pretty good job in this movie. James Gandolfini was absolutely terrible, but the actress who played his wife put in a redeeming performance. The characters do a lot of angsty things that I found annoying. Overall, it's just the sort of depressing movie about people you would have nothing to do with in real life. Why associate yourself with people who would be so self-destructive? It's the sort of movie that would probably have done better on TV, but not in a movie theater."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"This was a film that took a lot to get through. I stuck with it because I was told the ending was the best. No, it was not. I understand this was a play or a farce of films and Broadway, but it really had nothing to offer. Most of the action takes place in a restaurant or outside on the street. It is slow going, with nothing to offer. A nice cast, Jeffrey Tambor and Jesse Plemons, but it did not rise above mediocre. Not Recommended For Me."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"As many other reviewers have noted, Rio Lobo is not one of John Wayne's better western tales. Overall, it is pretty entertaining, but there is not much new to offer. In fact, the Duke kind of seems over the hill in this one.

The plot is pretty simple to follow, and there are some pretty good gun fights. But, the acting is pretty lacking. Therefore, I do not recommend watching this movie, unless you are a pretty big John Wayne fan. If not, check out some of his earlier Westerns."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,Do not buy/rent this movie unless you want to feel terrible about life. It has no moral value and is a POS in my opinion. 4 people all hooked on drugs with no real determanation to stop using but get more. It has a crappy ending that leaves you feeling terrible for those involved and put me in a bad mood  for wasting approximately 2 hrs. of my time when i could have watched somthing different. So unless you enjoy terrible movies that leave you feeling sad/depressed do not rent/buy.
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"You loyalists will probably hate me for writting this but I think this is one of the weakest star trek movies ever made.  What I mean is with the exception of Star Trek 5 the plot is the most poorly executed of all the Star Trek movies.
Some parts were great,
when Worf and Picard sang Gilbert and Sulivan
As always, the space battles
The Picard diplomacy tactic
Some parts were bad
Data and the children
Tori and Riker getting their hormones messed with
Please be kind to me, I just didn't like this movie all that much."

I highly suggest to save your money, and go rent/buy another flick.  You really couldn't pay me to own this, i would never watch it again. If you thought Lady in the Water was bad, you haven't seen anything yet..."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"These are good movies that as far as I can tell have had nothing done to the transfers.  Very poor.  However, the biggest problem is the price. Amazon saw fit to drop the price by $20 just after I ordered it, and this set had been released since 2007.  This is beginning to happen too often to me.  I don't appreciate it.  Consequently, Amazon is about to lose a very, very good customers.  This company is becoming fat and lazy. Beware and remember there are other vendors."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"As a fan of the work of George Clooney, Ryan Gosling, and Philip Seymour Hoffman, I expected to love this movie.  After watching it, I thought it was just ""OK"".  I was left wanting more passion in the overall film that I just wasn't feeling.  The only one I got that from was Hoffman and it wasn't enough to deliver that ""Wow!"" factor that makes a movie stellar.  I'd recommend it for a rainy day nothing to do sort of movie, but your viewing time could be better spent elsewhere."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"I am a big fan of SCREAM 1 & 2... and I was really hoping that Wes Craven might be able to succeed in this TRIOLOGY but as all triologies fall down... Scream 3 was as bad if not worse!
The scenes of 3 are much weaker than of 1 & 2... the thrill, suspense and surprises are very low!
If you are buying the Boxed set or building Scream library go ahead and buy it... if not don't consider it as it is very disappointing, at least in comparison to the 1 & 2 it failed!"
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"I completely understand the reviewer from Jan 18. and I thank you for your honest input. I couldn't get into this movie to save my life! And there was absolutely NO PLOT! Alanjay wanted a sequal to this one?  Oh please! If  you want exceptional cinematography, a beautiful lead actress, and A PLOT,  I suggest that extreamly weird flick ""The Pillow Book"".  Although  ""The Pillow Book"" wasn't that much of a good movie, at least it  had everything that all of the reviewers here claimed that this movie had."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,I'm a huge movie fanatic.  I've seen just about anything and everything.  I was so excited for this movie to come out because it's difficult to find a good horror movie that's not ridiculous these days.  Not only could I not follow this one nor did it hold my interest at all....but the plot was just poor.  I'm sure they were trying for something different here but I think it could have been better.  I wanted to give it one star but gave them an extra one for effort only.
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"The Help is an amazing story - that was not told at all by the movie. They left out the SERIOUS dangers that these women faced. There was no character development with Minnie, Leroy, Stuart, Miss Celia... Very disappointing. Skeeter's mother was made out to be a good person with a good heart deep down in the movie, but the book shows what a terrible person she really is - which made Skeeter's decisions and life even more difficult.
I'm happy the book is getting so much press - but REALLY don't understand why the movie is."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"Signs of cheap:
1. No subtitles for those with hearing issues and audio & pronunciation quality. 2. Stereotypical long opening scene of car driving on a road (cheap opener). 3. No cell reception with actor walking around holding phone in the air (there are actual websites devoted to movies with this timeworn hook). 4. Over exaggerated acting of annoying female and nonplussed male. Stereotypes en masse. Acting for the camera - acting. 5. Dialogue was so dumb I envisioned it being appropriately spoken by grade school children. Or, maybe a daytime soap TV created by kids. 6. Predictable feel good ending."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"A group of friends vacationing in a woodland cabin off in the middle of nowhere find a tape recorder that releases an evil spell, turning them into zombies. Wow, where did they put the plot? Better than the average effects  driven low budgeter featuring ugly people trying to kill one another.  Periodically followed by rip off immitators who don't come close enough to  topping this. Though, the modern hype does make inicial viewing of this a  disappointment, it leaves you with the desire to see it again soon after  seeing it once."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"Didn't Finish Viewing, but was a Good Film so far. Instead of Renting it again, I may consider Purchasing it. That s is a Fictionalized Account of the True Crime Scandal, but because of the Nature of the Crime and Reason, the Story is about as Sanitized as it could get. I would like to finally see this Story told as it was. Technicolor and Beautiful Costumes. Joan Collins Stars as the Showgirl/Artist's Model Evelyn Nesbit, but it's Marilyn Monroe with a Black Wig on the Cover Poster.
It would have been some Film with Ms. Monroe as Lead."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"A mediocre movie.  The production values are poor, the lighting looks like a TV soap opera, Sean Connery phones in a flat performance, Barbara Carrera is laughable, the story jumps around, barely hanging together.  I give Kim Basinger credit for delivering a fairly dignified performance in the midst of disaster; Edward Fox, who is capable of a good dramatic performance, and whom I typically like, plays M as a clown.

I'm content to own a copy, because it was the only Bond I didn't already have, but I don't know whether I'll ever bother to watch it again."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"The horror flicks of the 70's are finally showing up on dvd.  Like Gargoyles, Omega Man, The Devil's Rain and other genre flix from this period your memories will be fonder than the actual product.  This is a  good movie, and it makes me wonder what happened to Christina Raines.  The  movie benefits from a strong supporting cast, especially Burgess Meredith.  I wonder if Beverly D'Angelo lists this on her resume?  My only gripe with  the product is the lack of extras.  (All you get is the trailer.) I  recommend this film."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"There are two mistakes about this DVD. The English title for this Italian movie should be either Bread, Love and Dreams (original: Pane, amore e fantasia) or Bread, Love and Jealousy (original: Pane, amore e gelosia). The actors Vittorio de Sica, Gina Lollobrigida and Marisa Merlini played in both movies and the product description could easily be related to any of them. Both movies were directed by Luigi Comencini and not by Vittorio de Sica. Boudu Saved From Drowning is a very famous Jean Renoir movie from 1932. Both Italian movies are very good, but the one star is because of these mistakes."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"the casting of shaq as a rapping genie was silly enough, the story is completely hackneyed and false, and not even enjoyable in a so-bad-it's-good kind of way. the coup de grace however, is the horrid little chipmunk-faced boy (francis capra) we are meant to identify with. all he does is act bratty and sulk about how no one understands him, but his character is completely unlikeable. the only relief in this film is when he falls down an elevator shaft and for a few, sweet seconds, he seems to be dead. unfortunately he gets up.

and now we get to see it on dvd!"
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"I was disappointed in this video because I thought it was going to be the movie.  Instead, there was almost constant commentary by the screenwriter Ernest Lehman during the time the movie was playing.  His dialogue blocked out a lot of the movie dialogue.  It actually is a video about how the movie was shot.  It does say on the back of the DVD case that there is commentary but I didn't realize it would be all the way throughout the movie.  This might be a good video for people who are interested in how a movie is made."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"Maybe I expected too much, but I was disappointed. It was set up so well to be an amazing movie. Acting for the most part was real and to the point. In the middle it just turned into a mi between ""How to promote your business with Twitter for complete beginners"" training video, and an episode of Restaurant Impossible.
Jon Favreau went up a notch in my book, but entire movie was incomplete and too predictable. Ex-husband scenes were over the top and Sophia failed to convince as the ex. I SO WANTED THIS TO WORK! ARG! Enjoyable but failed to captivate. I was merely watching."

Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"Emily Lloyd did a great job of convincing me that she was Lynda. What I really never fully understood is why Lynda was Lynda. What was she really rebelling against, and if she was trying to prove something to herself and/or everyone else; why? This feels like a film that is missing crucial scenes, and throughout my viewing I kept expecting something, anything, that would underpin Lynda's desperate and self-destructive behaviour. While I did find the ending to be somewhat redeeming of Lynda's character, there just simply isn't enough plot or character development to push me over the hump to liking this film. Sadly, 2.5 stars."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"I'm not a huge F1 fan but was curious about the use of multi-angle features on this disk.  Was really expecting an ""in your face"" in-car driver perspective, with extended racing sequences....disappointed with final product.  Very fragmented, difficult to follow, repetitive highlights, in-car clips too short too enjoy, pointless selectable race stats etc.  Overall, they blew it! It could have been a great DVD if they had designed it to be a seamless experience for the fan!  As it is, consider it a novelty disk, and of interest only to diehard F1 fans...If you want racing action checkout Super Speedway or Driven instead!"
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"I was all hyped to watch this movie in the theater and, to me, it was a let down. The movie is about a good, decent, hard working man  called Nick Hume (Kevin Bacon) who looses his eldest son to gang rage.  It doesn't end there though--they want more.....
 Hume could go two ways: forgive or become a man of vengence.  Which way to go????
I will say that his ultra-impressive performances in  ""The Woodsman"" and ""Mystic River"" are nothing like he shows in this movie.  No depth of character for Bacon, which I believe is his bread and butter in the acting field."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,I swear I think American Dad and The Cleveland show is an excuse for Seth MacFarlane to get quick cash on suckers and idiots to watch this somewhat okay slop! I mean some of it is funny but Family Guy makes it funny from one random joke to another rather having a straight through plot point! I am not expert in criticizing  but I can take a wild armature's guess and get it right when I say this is okay but not close to being good as Family Guy! On the bright side this show has been cancelled but on the dark side American Dad is still kicking!
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"While this certainly is a beautifully produced tape, to say it is for beginners is misleading.  I certainly cannot twist and turn like this and modifications are left up to you to figure out.

If I were more flexible and stronger, I would rate this DVD with 5 stars because its really Yoga for Intermediate People.

Now my all time favorite real beginner's DVD is Pilates Complete for Inflexible People by Maggie Rhoades. You don't get the Hawaiian scenery but you should be able to tackle most of the exercises. Also the Rhoades DVD combines both Pilates and Yoga and actually shows beginner modifications using a chair, a strap and a pillow."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"Oh, MAN........you thought that insult to Johnny Cash, ""I Walk The Line"" was bad? I mean, Reese Witherspoon playing June?  Ugh, that's ALMOST ""The Last Waltz"" or ""Gimme Shelter"" compared to this tripe (the operative word there is ""almost""). Dennis Quaid does a LOT...an AWFUL lot...of ""mugging,"" but it's worse than Jehosaphat Phoneix affecting Johnny Cash's snarl.  And Winona Ryder just...DOESN'T project the...""jailbait quality"" of Myra Lewis.  She's just too old.  Do yourself a favor: grab any compilation of The Killer's performances during the 60's/70's...on upward, and alight on the ""Last Man Standing"" DVD where he has a decent backup band for the first time, almost, in his career."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"This video is really more of a fusion of ballet, Pilates and yoga than straight ballet: it's not like the ballet classes I remember.  The music is cheesy, new age garbage.  I don't understand why they couldn't use a more classical ballet score.

The exercises are difficult if you are out of shape like I am.  This is partly caused by the slowness of the exercises (like yoga).  There is very little movement---she seems to be concentrating much more on ""core"" (as in Pilates) than dance.  This is a workout, not a prep for dancing.  I wish I could find a more classical dvd that's really based on ballet."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"It should have worked, because It's a fun idea, but it falls painfully flat. It's hard to imagine Michael York as a serious seducer for one, and two, Angela Lansbury gives a performance that suggests that she is on a stage. It was a box office disaster, and you can see why. Harold Prince was a great stage director in his prime, unmatched really, but his two efforts into film, this and the appalling mess he made of 'A Little Night Music' revealed that he just didn't know what to do with the camera, or how to direct actors for film. Someone should turn it into a musical. I think it could work really work."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"This movie was made in the mid 1990s in Spain, it was directed by Jim McBride, based on a novel by Perez Reverte, and it stars a young Kate Beckinsale. Sounds promising? The movie's not. Basically, the plot has Beckinsale (with a boyish short hair cut) playing an art student in Barcelona, who finds that a flemish painting holds clues to some murder, or something. The whole thing is very dull, full with ridiculous situations and characters. The only thing to recommend for it is a couple of nude scenes by the young Kete (one in particular, with Kate topless for many seconds looking at a painting and sporting a grannie's panties is particularly memorable)."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"First off I want to say I can enjoy crude, mindless comedy as well as the next person but this movie is just too plain dumb, whether intentionally or not to enjoy. I chuckled a few times but was really very annoyed by the repetition in a lot of the scenes (""And Then"", Dude what's my tatto say?) Ironically I rented this because my 14 year old daughter wanted to see it and she didn't last through the movie because even she said it was too stupid. This movies target audience is 8 to 14 year old boys who probably get a big kick out of such stupidity. Unless you are in that category, skip this."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"Oh, M. Night...I've given you many chances. I loved Sixth Sense, Signs, Unbreakable, and the Village was decent. But this movie makes Lady in the Water look like a masterpiece. It was a glorified ""B"" movie at best, and I think I'm being generous. I could buy the storyline had another director taken on the task of making this film and developing the script to make it realistic. In contrast, it was like watching a train wreck...the dialogue was elementary and made the acting subpar and laughable. The story felt amateur and therefore comedic rather than scary. I'm suspecting that M. Night just gave up and needed to cash in to pay off some debts. Never again...never again..."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"Anyone with knowledge of Anne and Mary Boleyn and their relationships with Henry VIII will see that this is tabloid fiction, pure and simple. The timetables and events are total fabrications. Yes, Anne was alleged to have had relationships with her brother. But to see this depicted as fact in this movie? Well, just look at the costumes. I've seen better costumes on sale at the Halloween store. No one making this movie was interested in the facts.

Anne, Mary, Henry, Katherine, how could they not be rolling in their graves? The accounts are there. I'm sorry that some people will actually believe that this is the way that it was. Books. Go read some books. Books are good."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"I caught a portion of this movie on TV and it made me curious.  I found some time to kill and watched.  I was pleasantly surprised to find a good story, good acting, and a bit of a surprise twist towards the end.  There were some major production/ storyboard/ screenplay errors.  Like when the units go to the field and the whole thing is cut short, it was a surprise, but the execution was forced and it seemed like a story rip-off.  That part of the story/ screenplay cheapened the whole film and left me feeling empty, like something was missing.  Overall a good film, just a couple of portions felt unfinished."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"So i will start out with i do LOVE the fox and the hound and it is one of my favorite disney movies so i was real excited when i got home, but then i open it and they put the two dvd's in the same slot and the blu ray in a seperate slot, ARE YOU KIDDING ME??  i wouldn't have payed the extra money to get the blu ray if i knew that they would end up having the dvds in the same slot, my dvd has a high risk of getting scratched now and there is nothing i can do too prevent it since there isn't even a sop for a swivel disk. HORRIBLE PACKAGING."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"i was skeptical of this movie at first,for two reason reasons. number one is that it is a remake of an Asian film,which usually doesn't bode well. number two is that it seems we have been flooded with movies of this genre the last few years. neither my friend nor i had seen the original,and it would cost us nothing but our time,so we thought,what the heck,let's give it a shot. turns out it wasn't half bad,once it got going,just after the 40 minute mark. from that point on,things start happening,and a good little mystery begins to develop. Elizabeth Banks,who is a very good comedic actress,shows some great dramatic ability here. i would have given this movie a 4 if it hadn't taken so long to get going."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"Punch-Drunk Love is a decent movie with a sweet romance. It was slightly disappointing in that the whole movie seemed to hint at something more. I wholly expected a bit more character development, a bit more action (not in the ""Action Movie"" sense, but just in the ""get off your butt and do something"" sense), and a bit more resolution to the story. It seemed like the most interesting aspects of the story and the characters was only hinted at, and we never got to see them up close. It seemed like so much more could have been done with Barry's family, the love story, and virtually everything else in the movie. Not bad, just not nearly as good as it could have been."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"I really liked American Mary and it could have been a stellar film if the writers had paid a little more attention to the story and the plot - subplots they laid out.
Why the detective isn't immediately checking out the strip club Mary frequents is ludicrous considering everything else he knows about the case, and why after years of these rape parties hosted by the elite doctors of this university no one has spoken up is a pretty damn big stretch.
And what was that bizarre ""romance"" between the strip club owner and Mary? It seemed quite the afterthought.

All that aside, the look of the film, the effects, the acting and the plastic surgery disasters (Betty Boop and Barbie) are superb. Disturbing and effective creations indeed."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"Buy the Region 2 DVD (released by Fabulous Films in 2008) from amazon UK. It's widescreen (*not* pan & scan), plus it comes with a Director's Commentary which offers good insights from Joseph Sargent (who also directed the original ""The Taking of Pelham One Two Three"").

Admittedly, it won't be cheap. Current exchange rate amounts to eighteen bucks plus shipping. But you'll then be able to enjoy one of the classics of science fiction. It predates WarGames by more than ten years, and offers a more realistic--if darker--vision of the future of computer intelligence.

*********************
UPDATE November 2009
Looks like this has been discontinued by the manufacturer. Wonder if that means a proper Region 1 release (widescreen) might be in the works? Maybe a 40th Anniversary Edition next year??"
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"It another one of those movies where twins are played by the same actor.
This tired old trick was cute years ago with the Parent Trap.
But now it's dull now matter what type of plot they try.
This one is about a pot grower and a school teacher.
Maybe this might of been interesting if they had used real twins
as the actors.
Instead Edward Norton does a poor job of switching accents and
pretending to look at himself as a twin.
This very old visual trick never works.
You can tell when people do not make real eye contact with
each other.
This film might have even been interesting if they had used
two different actors who look kind of alike.
But overall it's not funny or full of action like Pinapple Express.
Don't waste your time."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"Unfortunately, this movie is not very good.  Such an epic moment in time truly deserves a good movie, and I was suckered into watching this on the grounds that I may have stumbled upon one.  Well, there was a reason why I'd never heard of this movie, that reason being: because this movie is really bad at being a movie.  It's EXTREMELY hackneyed and cliched, and doesn't make that okay by being fun to watch.  It's not bad because it's an anti-war movie or for any political reasons, it's bad because it's boring and poorly put together as a film.  Maybe someday they'll make a good movie about The Battle of the Somme, but as of 2016, that day hasn't come."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"I purchased all three videos in the Fast Food series, a whopping 78 bucks.  First off I'd like to say they are informative, Mr. Novick lays out a nice little template to create low fat, healthy, vegan recipes.  It is quick and easy.  However, he didn't have to show every step, every time, too much repetition, wasted video time.  The production values are in the toilet, my  15 year old has produced better for youtube. I did like the pdf files for the recipes that I printed, that was a nice bonus, but not  worth the $24 I paid for each dvd! All in all, good info for those of us new to a plant based diet, but way too expensive."

Obviously, this is a dangerous undertaking for Mann, who quickly winds up deceased in his own office. Oh no! The assassin was disguised as well-known, masked crime-fighter, THE SHADOW! Now, the police are after the mysterious hero. Can THE SHADOW's alter-ego, Lamont Cranston (Kane Richmond) track down the real killer, before the police close in? BEHIND THE MASK is more comedic than I'd expected, as the original SHADOW was a dark, almost sinister persona, able to frighten the criminal element he was pursuing. In this film, THE SHADOW is rather marginalized, while the unmasked Cranston does the sleuthing. While I did like this movie well enough, it's mostly for laughs. So, don't expect the more traditional, serious SHADOW..."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"My godson and his brother partied to this DVD for about a week then grew tired with the corny music and hum-drum routines. Some of the dance moves are mature and suggestive but most children will have no idea about the steps they'll just innocently follow along.  I'm not certain whether or not this is a good thing. If I'd had the opportunity to preview this DVD I definitely would not have purchased it however, since I did buy it I can say that it was worth the money for the few days of rest it afforded my friend and her husband.  The more I think about it they might have simply played the video of their wedding reception for free and gotten a better response from the boys."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"This was the worst kid's movie I have ever seen! My kids really enjoyed the original, so when my 3-year old begged me to get this at the store today I figured it would make for a nice family movie night. This was not the case at all. There is a lot of standing around talking at the beginning that just about put everyone to sleep. Then we were able to watch a bunch of flashbacks from the original movie. It says the film is 44 minutes but it's really only 39, so about 25 minutes of actual new movie since there are so many scenes included from the previous movie! This was a terrible rip off and makes me angry that I was tricked into buying it by the false advertising."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"Some films that you used to love, just don't hold up. And this epic soap is one of them. In the acting department, Mercedes Mc. Cambrige walks away with the film, and Carol Baker is extremely effective. I so wanted to love this film all over again, but it's lost a lot of its magic. The aging makeup is terrible, and James Dean performance suddenly seeems ridiculously mannered. If it had looked a good as it should, it would have helped enormously, but this is a terrible transfer. Sorry to be a spoil sport, but compared to some of the great classics from the '40's, this isn't in the same league. I'm happy that so many people still love it however. For me - I think I've watched it for the last time."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"Admittedly, casting Atlanta Braves' bad boy John Rocker as a serial killer was an inspired piece of casting.  However, big John is hardly in the film at all.  Which means we're left with a cast of really bad actors running around in their bathing suits and what not, and even with some innovative methods of offing the victims, THE GREENSKEEPER breaks no new ground in the art of film-making.  There are, however, some priceless lines:  having three of the boytoys named Chad, Chet and Chuck (or something like that); when one of the bimbos has to cancel her vacation because the island is being taken over by guerillas, she innocently says ""I didn't even know they had a zoo.""
A lame, tired rip off of all the slasher movies you've ever seen."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"I bought this DVD for 5 bucks, and I still overpaid.  I wanted to like this movie!  It's a great premise.  It has Sam Jackson in it!  How bad can it be?  Well, the antidote to any potentially great movie is Bruce Willis.  He's no Kevin Costner now, I'll grant you that.  But he's very near the bottom in terms of acting ability.  In this flick, we're not really sure if he's mentally challenged or an adult or what. It's hard to tell since Willis seems that way in real life.  Not the sharpest tool, if you will.  His lack of acting chops ruins an otherwise great movie.  Hopefully, someone will do it again with a real lead actor who knows how to ... act."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"I love Key and Peele but have to admit that this movie was very silly. I laughed aloud in several places but not nearly enough. The comedians that starred in this film have so much talent that seemed a bit wasted because this movie was about 15-20 mins longer than it should have been. This would have been terrific as a 1 hour Key & Peele comedy special, but it doesn't quite work as a feature film.

As other reviewers have mentioned, the kitten that played Keanu was absolutely adorable!! That cat was the true star of this movie. And it's precious that Keanu Reeves was the voice of the cat in one scene of the movie.

If you can see Keanu for $3.99 or less, then watch it. If it costs more than that, I would pass."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"It's like watching a ABC After School Special trying its best to be horror. It's goreless, boring and so bad it's not even good variety. What's more scary then the movie is the people who gave this film 5 stars. 48% of 50 some reviews gave it 5 stars?!? How is that even possible that at least 25 people on this planet, and I know there are more, think this is as good as such horror films that generally get 5 stars from fans and critics like Halloween, A Nightmare On Elm St, The Exorcist ect... Obviously there is a second edit of this movie floating around that I'm not privy to. A edit that incorporates everything that makes a 5 star horror film. Gore, suspense, good acting ect..... Man I would love to see that version!"
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"I love period dramas, and I thought the the premise of the series, the start of the New South Wales penal colony towards the end of the eighteenth century would certainly be of interest. Shot on location in Australia, the series had excellent production values. The sets and costumes gave it an air of period authenticity. The acting was excellent. The convicts, men and women were suitably grubby.. So, what was the problem?

The scripts were simply sub-par. Melodramatic, with overlays of twenty first century social and sexual mores that effectively kill any authenticity of time and place, the writing is what finished off any chance of a second season. Not even the excellent acting could validate the almost ridiculous plotlines. Still, I derived some enjoyment from this series, if only because cause I have a soft spot for period dramas."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"Struck by lightning, a powerful battle robot achieves consciousness and escapes from its creator.  Pursued by the military, Number 5, as it is called, is befriended by a sweet-natured animal-loving numbskull (Ally Sheedy), the robot's reclusive inventor (Steve Guttenberg), and an offensive East Indian stereotype (Fisher Stevens).  This is a very bad movie.  Unlike so many other reviewers on this page, I found it to be dull and mechanical, a by-the-numbers production with a clunky and unappealing robot at its center, filled with stock characters that do and say exactly what you think they will because you've seen it all a million times before.  Boo.  I was shocked that the screenwriters, Brent Maddock and S.S. Wilson, are the same people who would go on to write the B-movie classic, ""Tremors.""  They obviously improved over time."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"This is a movie really meant to be watched in a theatre, instead I watched it on a Kindle 10"" Fire HDX.  The visuals and CGI are superb, easily the best since the now ancient Apollo 13.  Sandra Bullock & George Clooney give good performances.  Unfortunately the story & script just don't hold up under even minor scrutiny.  Space Shuttle crews trained together for a year more before a mission, but from the start, Clooney as mission commander, appears to have only just met Bullock, who plays a scientist intent of upgrading the Hubble telescope.  Later, it's made known that Clooney doesn't know even where Bullock lives.  For me, a thread of unbelievability runs throughout the movie, which could easily have been fixed had the producers hired a genuine SST astronaut as an advisor to the script."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"First off, Who names these movies ? My gosh...
Very funny vignettes of male lead trying to find true love, Or at least Normal love.
Can't get over that title, When you watch the movie, And you should it has girls and romance and funny bits thru out,You will wonder ""WHY or Why ?"" Did they name it that...
Matthew James ( Merl  on ANGEL  tv series) is very likable and makes sense out of this love-starved artist role and has some good luck in bed too.
Sadie Katz (AB Buddy spokesmodel ) has A DEMI MOORE-esque vibe and seems a whole person in character,Not someone off a written page.
Jacqui Holland has an uncredited role as a sidewalk pickup, She and her tattoo make some very funny moments early on in film.
So, Icky title, Great premise and actors capable of making it almost 'sweet romance'."

Then they get Kathy Bates and Angela Bassett, two extraordinarily talented women. It takes place is the beautiful city of New Orleans, and there's even Voodoo and witch craft!!! But they barely do anything with this! The first few episodes are good, but it just got bland! Very bland! I kept paying for the episodes, thinking that there is no way that this isn't going to get better at some point. It never does.  You have the opportunity to really use Voodoo and Witchcraft and historical New Orleans to capitalize on the creepy as in previous seasons of American Horror Story and then hardly use these things to your advantage in this season? Probably enough said.  My best advice? Wait and watch it for free!"
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"This review in not for the movies which I consider them to be great. This review is for the product itself: I bought an used set in Amazon and the phantom of the Opera won't play in any of my HD DVD players HD-A20 HD-A30 and HD-D2. The Fugitive had pixel problems in all players and the same happened to the unforgiven. the only movie that was OK was The Last Samurai. Then I decided to buy a set that was new, thinking that the reason why the previous one, wouldn't play was because it was used and therefore somehow damaged. Well to my surprise the brand new one had exactly the same problem. therefore I don't recommend this set to any one. By the way all of the players have the latest 4.0 firmware update, so the players should not be the issue."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"The above line spoken by Oscar winner Hilary Swank is indicative of the dialog in this special effects driven sci-fi saga. Swank plays an astronaut who along with Bruce Greenwood must pilot Virgil, a craft designed to burrow (with the assistance of one really mean laser beam) to the earth's core in an attempt to correct an imbalance that was doing serious damage to the surface above.
Also along on this unbelievable trip to the earth's center are  respectable performers in stereotypical roles: Aaron Eckhart (the voyage's ""studly"" college professor), Alfre Woodard (mission commander), Delroy Lindo (the ship's inventor and symbol of self-sacrifice), Stanley Tucci (the despicable scientific genius with a hidden agenda), and Richard Jenkins as the mysterious military hardliner.
The film is passable entertainment.

Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"Sick & Stupid Score:  6/9*

More of the current national neurosis that is gripping the Ritalin Generation:  Your memories are not your own; you have no idea who you are; an evil force is controlling your life.  And way more of the feminist fantasy that girls can be as tough as boys.  More escape-and-capture sequences than a 1930's cowboy and Indian Saturday matinee movie.  More ""Blade Runner""-style racial diversity than ""Blade Runner.""  More computer-generated graphics than....

When will these awful movies ever end?

* The Sick & Stupid Score ranks movies from zero to ten in each category. For example, a Sick & Stupid Score of 5/5 indicates the movie is about average Sick and about average Stupid.

This movie by far (besides Gigli) has to be the biggest disappointment.  I wish it would've flopped in the box office, but like idiots we go see it & leave in shock of the suckiness that took place.  When the movie ended you were like ""that's it, that sucked.""

Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"I had to force myself to finish this movie. I watch a movie for a story and to be entertained. Period. I'm not a film critic or a psychologist.  While I watched this movie I figured that somewhere along the line, something had to make sense. It didn't.  Besides, just because a movie is obscure, strange, whatever, doesn't make it deep!

I watched it on Netflicks (instant on Roku), so at least I didn't waste money on it.  Actually, I've had more interesting nightmares!!  Humm.......maybe I should make a movie.

And, I've never seen so many, ""open-minded"",""deep-thinking"" adults(?) incapable of accepting difference of opinion. Grow up guys, its just a movie.

A 1977 review of Eraserhead by Variety called it a ""sickening bad-taste exercise"" which ""pulls out all gory stops in the unwatchable climax....the mind boggles to learn that Lynch labored on this pic for five years"

Ms. Cho's son is an attorney for South Korea. why didn't they prosecute the mother in law with 2 counts of attempted murder? I know that unfortunately the East is not a litigious society like the west. I also know that in the East there is a history of suicidal protests like 1) Buddhist monk burned himself to death in 1960's Vietnam, 2) girls burning themselves protesting their husbands in Afghanistan, 3) Japanese jumping off cliffs with babies in arms because they feared the Americans at end of WWII, 4) Japanese samurai's hary cary, 5) 17 suicides in Chinese factory in 2 years because of poor working conditions.

Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"I rented this DVD only out of curiosity because I had heard of this often overlooked sci-fi entry made by Mario Bava. To be honest, given its' B-movie status, I was expecting a rather one dimensional gore-fest.

Nothing could be further from the truth. Even at this early point in his career, one can see how talented a director Bava is.

Clearly shot on a low budget, like Roger Corman, Brava, by using some very clever camera approaches and wonderfully creative sets (its' quite obvious the makers of the Alien films used this along with other 1950s' B-movies as sources)constructs a film that is both intelligent and engaging.

An interplanetary crew from Earth, answering a distress signal from another planet, land and get more than they bargained for. Very smart, underplayed and scary.

At times I felt I was watching an episode of a well done Star Trek entry.

Very well done. Worth the rental."

They don't start smoothly or precisely, and many extra features play at one-quarter sized image in upper left corner of screen only. ""Niagara"" barely plays at all. Incidentally, this ""collection"" arrived as 9 individual Blurays shrink-wrapped together. Kind of curious.  Something strange here. I'd pass. I believe completely the reviews claiming defective disks. Performance may vary based on specific bluray players. Why take a chance? And, although I have purchased many items from Amazon with high satisfaction, please be keenly aware that you have a scant 30 days after delivery to return defective goods. I dare say most unfair in regard to series of DVD's and Blurays. Totally unrealistic to view a set in 30 days. I'm stuck with this defective product. That and the new $35 plateau for free shipping will make me shop here less frequently."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"A waste of money, time and film. Not clever and not even funny. It's filled with over the top violence and vulgarities and this is coming from someone who doesn't mind violence and vulgarities if it adds to the story.
That's not what happened here however. If I had a dollar for every time a character used the f-word (an most characters did, multiple times in one sentence.) I could have made a decent wad of cash. The f-word happens in real life of course, I use it on occasion, but this was forced into the majority of dialogue just to be...to be what? Edgy? Hip? With it? If so, it didn't work.
  As for the story? A James Bond want-to-be with none of the charm or wit. That's this movie in a nutshell.
There were no redeeming qualities to this film for me. I wish I could get my $3 back."

to get some ""parchment with a magical message""  which he believed he deserved to receive.  In order to get that parchment, he violently tortured, and attempted to kill the man who brought him up and loved him dearly. Never mind that this character is  ten times the size of his mentor. This character will scare small children to death. He is VERY VERY VIOLENT,WITH A DISPLAY OF SUCH ANGER THAT UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD BE SEEN BY AN ADULT MUCH LESS A CHILD. SUCH A CHARACTER WOULD BE CONSIDERED  MENTALLY ILL, AND CHILDREN WILL THINK THIS BEHAVIOR IS APPROPRIATE WHEN THEY THINK THEIR PARENTS ARE UNFAIR TO THEM.

Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"It is definitely not the style of movie that I like, but I loved, I think, the entire cast's acting. Robert De Niro is one of my very favorite actors, and as I very much expected, he did not disappoint. I also loved Jody Foster, I have seen many movies of hers, and I also love her acting very much. I liked Peter Boyle also, whom I got to know from ""Everybody Loves Raymond,"" and from what I saw in Taxi Driver, there is a mischievous quality about him that seems to come through always. And last, but not least, Harvey Keitel just blew my mind! If you haven't seen it yet and like, or at least tolerate, this particular genre of gore, I'm willing to bet that, in seeing these actors' work in their beginnings will show clearly and unmistakably the reason why they have become huge stars and received so many accolades."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"Dracula
too long & too slow

Keanu Reeves was probably the weakest link.  His British accent has been described as too posh.  His acting is wooden & unconvincing.

Winon Rider is fine though her British accent is also overdone (though more convincing than Keanu's).

The costumes and makeup are amazing

Frankenstein

Just did not work -- the beginning, middle, and end do not come together

While Branagh gets to show off his athletic torso that is not enough to save the film.

Something between Branagh & Helena Bonham Carter doesn't work.  They have no chemistry together?

There are so many things in this film that do not make sense.  For example, Frankenstein cuts off a head to use for the monster & uses a different brain.  So why is the monster's face a patch work of stitches?  Apparently, there was no reason why Frankenstein would use a different lip or cheek or eye, but the stitching was supposedly scarier."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"Ok, for a darkly introspective, sloooow movie about a deeply miserable main character, this was ok. This is a story about a girl who kills a man's family in a car accident and spends the rest of the movie fighting her own guilt and trying to make his life better. That's it. If you know that going into it (and are still interested) it might be a good movie. But if you're expecting a movie about ""Another Earth"", forget it, you'll get none of that here, aside from a few musings of what it all might mean to us played on radios and TV's the characters have on now and then. There are NO special effects other than ocasional shots of the other earth in the sky above ours. Calling it science fiction is a little misleading, unlike the title which is very misleading. It'd be better described as a long, drawn-out, dark episode of the Twilight Zone."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"Harrison Ford just doesn't cut it as a bad guy, although he gets an ""E"" for effort.  His good-guy image is central to the suspense in this film that works hard to keep the viewer from believing that Ford is the true villain.  Obstepterous new neighbors are brought in to divert the viewer's suspicions that the most likely villain is Ford. Far too much time is spent on frontal face shots of Michelle Pfeiffer mulling over the spooky experiences she has after sending her daughter off to college.  Here again another diversion, the empty nest syndrome, is used to keep attention away from the true villain, Ford.

Major impetus was the terminal nature of her original successes writing ""young adult"" (i.e. teeny bopper) novels, which in All Co Hell impaired *teeny bopper* fashion she treats as the end of the world.  ""I think you should leave"" is what she got from her target after having been invited to a baby naming party at the direction of the target's *wife*.  The whole story reminded me of the recent 2015 Jana Kramer C&W song ""I Got the Boy, She Got the Man"".  Too much involved in her own high school level fictional writings to complete evolving her own adult personality.  Well enough acted, photographed, and produced to maintain a three star rating."

But it finally dawned on me as the credits rolled that I had been had.  What I don't understand is why the critics or Alton think that sitting through hours of watching people, one would barely tolerate in real life, chat about nothing for 2 hours constitutes an important film or even entertainment for that matter.

This is a series of Jason Martel's lectures that he is just doing a recorded presentation of.  He has a picture in picture of himself talking to you in the lower part of the screen.  The slide presentation has not been optimized for this and his video covers up much of the data (charts, imagery...) he is trying to describe.
More often than not he is staring/talking at his computer screen highlighting parts of the imagery with his mouse instead of the audience.  This could have just had him narrating without the video of him.  I would assume the rest of the DVD series is more of the same.
The audio is recorded over the computer mic and has that very hollow speakerphone-ish sound.  You can understand what is being said, but sound is annoying.

Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"While this film ostensibly is based on an American novel, its plot and themes seem stolen from ""Martin Fierro,""  a 19th century Argentine epic gaucho poem.  There are plenty of beautiful landscapes and scenes of stampeding cattle to keep you visually entertained---in addition to pretty Gene Tierney and hubba-hubba-hubba Rory Calhoun.  Both wander around through part of the film with strategically torn tops that chastely communicate ""come hither.""  Calhoun is wooden as befits his role, and Tierney just sits, stands, and faints throughout the film, looking Gene Tierneyesque but not having much to do. Hugh Marlowe of ""All About Eve"" fame offers a lot of platitudinous talk of ""progress"", of the end of the barbarous life of the gauchos when confronted by the forces of the city (i.e.civilization).  This is a motif of Argentine history and a standard of Western fare.  See the flick and chalk if off as a Western set in the Southern Hemisphere."

However all said and done the acting is extremely bad, like sonething out of a 1950's film. Marrion Ross should have stayed in the yester year with Happy Days.

The Directors should have done their home work on the German regalia. Uniforms and emblems where worng. At about 1 hour 20 minutes into the film it shows a date Agust 21st 1944 and the apparent Russian attck which drives the Germans out. In reality this happened in July 1944 when the Red Army re-took Przemyael.

So although this film has good intentions the people who filmed in it should have paid more attention to detail and got decent actors in it and not made it look like a budget movie. Alot more care should be taken when depicting real life events."

If not for one little problem, I would have thoroughly enjoyed this film. The problem is in the presentation. Since the entire movie is supposed to come from a single hand-held camera, everything is in Shaky-Cam (or, as Roger Ebert aptly called it, ""Queasy-Cam""). Hence, the movie quickly and continually induces vertigo in its audience; of the six members of my party, four reported some degree of motion sickness. Somewhere further down in the theater, we heard at least one person vomit. No matter how good a movie is -- and this one is, in its way, very very good -- it suffers when you can't bear to look at the screen. It's hard to appreciate the filmmaker's craft when you're trying to keep down the buffalo chicken sandwich you foolishly ate on the way to the theater. by Tom Knapp, Rambles."

The eleventh and twelfth season episodes clearly lack the polish and good story lines of all the other episodes.  James MacArthur who played Danno in the series preceding the eleventh and twelfth seasons is sorely missed.  As good as the new characters are such as William Smith (always a pleasure to watch) it just isn't the same, along with weaker and almost ridiculous story lines.  It is the opinion of this viewer that perhaps Jack Lord was not the easiest individual to work with.  His character overall tended to be rather absent of nuance and depth.  Without Danno and all the other wonderful personalities around him, he rather fades into background.  The very final episode has Lord as the sole ""hero"" finally ensnaring his nemesis Wo Fat.  The episode quite fell flat (pardon the poor rhyme).  Seasons 1 through ten are stellar."

There is no discernible story worth caring about and NONE of the actors roused me to root for or care about them. The movie just goes on insufferably from one disconnected, disjointed scene to the next.

There is no structure to this film other than a loose stream of scenes and unattractive people, especially Sgt. Yu who's supposed to be so hot everybody wants her. She's sullen, somber, withdrawn, sour, and even that is limp and lame.

Occasionally inspired cinematography, some nice little shots, small vignettes, nothing any film school grad should not be able to do.

I'm out of stuff to write about. NOTHING here. NOTHING going on. I turned it off at 48 minutes.

In fairness, in reading the other reviews, it seems Asian fans and others got a lot more out of it than I did, so maybe it's cultural. OK, so I'm old school, USA---REALLY Old School.

You do not have tell a lie when you do not have to say something. In the movie it considers you have to say what you are thinking. It is not real.

He emotes nothing, and with a beard it's less than nothing. I almost felt as if there was a movie being filmed and he was silently photo-bombing every seen. They sold us this directorial masterpiece and we bought it. It just didn't even come close to a masterpiece and someone must have ""bought"" them the Oscar. Life of Pie should have been Best Picture; it out ranks this bar-none.

The father quietly goes about his woodworking and lets the action play out. Along with this family scenario, Madeline seeks out a backwoods artist to sign for her gallery. This creates a conflict when a crisis in the pregnancy draws the family together, while Madeline tends to business. The film is marred by too many scenes with low lighting make the viewer guess what's going on with whom. Additionally many scenes are muttered through and possibly key information gets missed. At first I thought Madeline was the focus of the film, but the other daughter-in-law captures the attention through the majority of the film.

4) lots of bad acting;

5) awful music of any genre.

SPEED DEMON is no exception, although this is one of his less entertaining films.  The others at least had some modicum of suspense and/or horror.  This movie has no suspense, no horror, no real gore, no sex scenes (unless you count the numerous times the boys spread some kind of blood all over their buff chests.

This short-lived sitcom also takes me back to memory lane to when I used to watch it after HAPPY DAYS every Tuesday night on ABC when I was 9 years old in the 3rd grade and when we had all those budget cuts going on from the recession we had back in 1981-1982 when Ronald Reagan was President."

Ashton Kutcher and Jamie Foxxx are really lame in this movie, as are most of the characters and situations that are squeezed in to give all the stars enough face time.  I thought it was interesting to see Julia Roberts in an army uniform, never thought I would see that.  The movie doesn't even really end with that much of a ""feel good"" ending.  I thought it was comical that someone as gorgeous as Jessica Biel could possibly be a frustrated single that can't get a date.  I don't think Jessica Biel has ever had to go without a date ever.

Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"Loved the movie, but it left a bad (director (Besson), and so called visual effects) after taste.
The first BIG downer, was when Lucy was repeatedly kicked in the stomach by a drug czars henchmen, when they knew the very expensive drugs where inside her belly; REALLY?  The next blunder was on the part of the so-called visual effects people (there were a few of them to blame), when they used the old roll the room effect that is so old and lame, that nobody uses it anymore. REALLY?
I found the effects (or the lack of) the most offensive part of the movie, especially the growing black computer fingers; REALLY?
Not a bad movie with a 40mil budget/88 min running time, and I am sure Scarlett and Morgan got a large share of it, as it was not well spent on the production.
Compare this with the 2012 The Avengers, at 220mil/143 min running time, and you can see it was a low budget film from the start, and for that reason, they actually did a pretty good job."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"I haven't read the well regarded comic book (er, sorry, graphic novel), but this movie is terribly dull. The idea of taking well known characters from the Victorian Era's popular literature (Allan Quartermain, Captain Nemo, Tom Sawyer, Dr. Jekyll, Dorian Gray, The Invisible Man from the novel by H.G. Wells, Mina Harker from Dracula) and rethink them as superheroes sounds odd but interesting. And if such endeavor would make some young people read the original books, one can certainly sympathize with that. But this film is dull. The action scenes are uninspired. And one wonders if the filmmakers even read the original material: here Dorian Gray has more lives than Terminator, Verne's Captain Nemo looks more like Sandokan, Jekyll is inspired more by the incredible Hulk than by the character of Robert Louis Stevenson's novel, Tom Saywer is a hothead cowboy rather than Mark Twain's country boy, etc. There are fine actors here (Sean Connery, for one) but they look embarrassed here, as well as they should be.

However, when you look at the lists of the most profitable movies of all time, you find many science fiction titles - E.T.

To be fair, there is much sci-fi that isn't done well, however when it's a focused production like Alien Nation, audiences are treated to quality, intelligent entertainment with more than just car chases and gun fights.

I'd never heard of this film in all these years and though it was decent to watch I can see why it never made a big impact.

For a romance it was disappointing. The characters are thrown together and fall in love in a day. I guess it's supposed to be spontaneous but it just seemed ridiculous to me. The so-called villains act like they jumped out of a Pink Panther cartoon.

This was definitely a mixed bag for me. It starts off intriguing but becomes less and less interesting as it goes on.

I wouldn't have kept watching it if Tim Daly hadn't looked so hot in it. He looks good with a mustache!

I wasn't too impressed by how the film looked. It hasn't held up well at all in 20 years. This was made in 1992 but the quality of the movie makes it seem like it was made in '72."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"This movie was a pure waste of time - the story lacks originality as its basic premise of good fighting evil seems to be a rehash of other famous fantasy classics like LOTR. Director Uwe Boll who also gave us movies like BloodRayne seems bent on insulting viewer's sensibilities by producing fantasy movies that lack originality.

The basic premise here - Jason Statham (The Transporter) plays Farmer, a simple laborer who gets embroiled in an epic battle of good versus evil when Duke Fallow (Matthew Lillard) conspires with a magician named Gallian (Ray Liotta) to overthrow King Konreid (Burt Reynolds). There are other familiar names in the cast -Leelee Sobieski, John Rhys-Davies, Ron Perlman, Claire Forlani, Kristanna Loken, Brian J. White , all of whom add little to pique one's interest in the movie.

The acting on the whole is pretty average, and the Krugs look like they are a poor imitation of the Orcs from LOTR. All in all, this comes across as a cheap, uninspired knock-off of other fantasy classics and is not worth wasting one's money on. I would recommend passing on this one."

Somehow, though, I suspect that even Vadim would have done better by this material than Godard.  After all, he has a good cast (Bardot included), good source material (a novel by Albert Moravia), and the services of Raoul Coutard, one of the best cinematographers in the history of film.  And what to we get?  About 90 minutes of mind-numbing agony as Godard plays film-school in-jokes and stretches scenes out to tedium mostly to prove that he won't truckle to commerical interests.

I know they were trying to tell the backstory to the series but they could do that and still wow us. The acting was very dry and that made it unbelievable to me.

The actors are given so little to work with that scenes must be propelled with clenched teeth, furrowed brows, and pained brooding.  None of them seem like they could have possibly had a minute of fun in their whole lives.  The color palette is dreary and limited.  The musical cues are mind numbingly predictable.  The camera angles are never inventive.  Except for a couple of new visuals, it's so much of the same old same old.

- The presentation could have been better.  The background & lighting is drab with a crinkly velvet curtain that distracts the eyes from following her movement. And in parts she seems too absorbed in following her movements in the mirror in front of her rather than demonstrating a movement to the viewer.
- The filming has been done from behind and the sideway. So you don't really get to see a good full view of each movement. And unless you zoom in the dvd player, you can not clearly see a front view of the movements in the mirror in front of which she demonstrates the moves.
- The moves are demonstrated in isolation and there is not enough explanations for each movement as if she is careful not to give too much away.  No combination of movements demonstrated.

The performance part is ok, but not as good & natural as she usually is.  The dvd is mostly for beginner's level and doesn't have much originality.  Apart from her choosing good descriptive names for a few of the moves, on the whole this dvd lacks substance as an instructional one."

I have seen the makers of this movie talk on talk shows and they give much more information than is on this DVD.  I think you would need to take a thousand different scenarios and then ask them how to deal with them before you could apply this philosophy because it is very confusing.  Kind of like scientology is so confusing and needs intense instruction to learn, I believe this ""secret"" needs alot more information and instruction to apply it so that it works as it states it does.

When George's former boss Bob (Michael Fairman) hears about it he goes catatonic, like Ned seeing the Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka (South Park season 2). Laura assumes a new identity to infiltrate the home as a nurse so she can bump off Bob's family in front of him.

The terror and acting were both lame. Except for the rare F-bomb, this could have been a made for TV movie. Perhaps my biggest disappointment was right after I obtained this film I discovered it was available in a multi-film pack for the same price.

Rare F-bomb, no sex or nudity. What this movie really needed was for Demi Moore to play the lead with a token shower scene and a little more success and creativity in killing off relatives."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"After watching  a couple episodes of ""An Idiot Abroad,"" I had trouble sleeping because of the suffering of this man.  The look on his face as he looked up at his would be captors showed a level of fear, confusion and pain which I found to be unbearable to see.  Having watched ""Extras,"" it seemed impossible to believe that Ricky Gervais would deliberately cause a person to be sick, hungry, sleepless and afraid.
  At the beginning of the episode where Karl is in China, Karl says ""is he havin a laugh? and I thought that perhaps Gervais, Merchant and Pilkington are `avin a laugh"" on us and that this was a deliberate reference to ""Extras."".  I hope that is the case.  This would mean that the viewers are shown to be the sadists that those who made the show suspected they would be.  I also began to doubt that Karl is the childlike person he is portrayed as being because although childlike people say funny things at times, they tend not so say funny things continuously. Also, Karl Pilkington makes no funny comments about a man whose face is deformed.  Perhaps Karl Pilkington is a very clever man who is good at keeping a straight face."

After trying to provide justice to the notorious outlaw Butch Cavendish, ranger John Reid (Hammer) is shot and left for dead. When he is rescued by a Comanche Indian named Tonto (Depp) he is told of his destiny and together they ride again to stop Cavendish, this time as Tonto and The Lone Ranger. Going into this I was not expecting much at all. I was really not excited to see this for a few reasons. One was because I am too young to remember the TV series and I am not a big Johnny Depp fan at all. One other reason is the preview made it look slap-sticky and campy and nothing that I thought looked good. Even with those low expectations this movie wasn't all that good. There were some pretty funny parts and I did laugh throughout but this is really only a one time watch at most. To be fair I did expect it to be worse but the movie could have been an hour shorter and I would have been fine with it. Overall, long and drawn out. To long for kids to stay interested in and to boring for adults to stay interested in. I give it a C+."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"Be aware that there are only three Melies shorts on this disk and only one of them is in color. A Trip to the Moon is on the disk twice, once in color and again in B&W. There is a choice of two excellent  musical tracks on the B&W films, but the color film only has one soundtrack. It is completely unidiomatic, has distracting mumbling voices, and it doesn't follow the action of the film. Worse yet, it omits Melies's own narration that is supposed to be part of the film.  Nothing makes sense without it. The cheezy synth music sounds like the loopy soundtrack to a 1970s mutton chop midget porn movie. The film is best watched with the volume turned down. The rest of the disk is filled out with a feature length documentary which is interesting, but I can't imagine watching it more than once.

For a little more money you can get a five disk Flicker Alley DVD collection of Melies with dozens of great films, many of which are in even more beautiful color than this one. I'd recommend getting that instead. Search ""melies flicker alley"" and you'll find it. There is a supplement DVD that completes the set too.

Three completely bland, removed, uninspiring, predictable shorts that are too long and really give no real insite into the state of the ""American Family"". There's nothing thought provoking here, these shorts make an attempt to shock it's audience with violence that ends up doing nothing to add to or help drive any real message home. That's the peoblem with all three films from the very beginning you know what the message is (none being at all enlightening) and then are forced to watch a long drawn out story with no twists, no insight, and does absolutely nothing to relate to the viewer or to draw you in, 2 of which are ended with a scene of violence that utimately means nothing. The scenes are meant to shock but end up being just another scene that just happens to have blood in it. Theres no emotion, no character developement, it's bland and dull- uneffective.

Bottom line- 1.if you want something thought provoking this is not it. 2.if you're looking for gore and blood look somewhere else this just won't satisfy 3.if you're looking to be dissapointed look no further, this ones for you 4. Extremely over rated. Unfortunatly nothing special, that's why you can buy it used for  like 3 bucks"
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"I am a horror genre junkie, and whereas I really loved The Blair Witch Project, I really disliked this. I walked away from the theater, which had 6 other people in it, going seriously, I paid for this?? Even my 19 year old son wasn't impressed and he scares easily. I kept waiting for the feeling of fear to hit me and it never did. I looked at my phone to check the time and it was an hour in already and nothing fantastic had happened yet.

My 24 year old daughter saw it before me and told me you had to believe in order for it to scare you. I do believe there are spirits and hauntings, yet I couldn't get this movie to scare me one bit until the very last scene, which I won't divulge and ruin it for people. Every time the story line would move toward scary, it suddenly shifted away.

I watch shows like A Haunting and Extreme Paranormal and in my opinion, those are scarier than Paranormal Activity. I wasn't impressed and wanted my money back. My husband wanted to see it and I told him he'd be better off to wait for it to hit DVD and watch it then. If you haven't seen it, rent the movie before you buy it."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"Earth Songs (2012) - (Narrated By Michael York - Actor), (Directed by Brian Luke Seaward - Expert in stress management, mind-body-spirit healing) is the most succinct argument against doing what may have been intended to be an inspirational voice-over in an otherwise visually breathtaking production I've seen recently.  I'm writing this as I'm almost done watching the program on 'mute'.  I frankly couldn't take the insipid palaver.  For about two minutes at the beginning, I was hoping the pap-y-talk would change to something informative or smarm-free.  It didn't.

Here's proof that a fairly accomplished actor with a British inflection can't actually keep up with stunning cinematography when trying too hard to say grammatically correct but meaningless, flowery verbiage.  The attempt to sound poetic is pathetic.  This production is the 'nature' equivalent of the Roman Polansky film Tess (1979) - Gorgeously shot, lifeless, bland, and numbingly tedious.  You find yourself wishing that something would happen.  It doesn't, but Michael York drones on relentlessly anyway.

If you're considering watching this production, let alone buying it, I'd recommend you find something interesting to watch instead.  That way you won't miss the good parts due to having your head snap back, swallowing your tongue, and dying a horrible death from the verbal anesthesia in this production."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"(1.) Anne is attractive and the film is so dependent on it that she and the camera exploit it with constant close ups of her face and her charming/beguiling but theatrically pointless expressions (over 50% of the film actually).
(2.) Plot is a rip off of other crash movies where we are led to believe they're alive but they're not.
(3.) Dialogue is very poorly scripted with cliched non-professional exchanges between roles such as Wilson as the ex-corporate V.P. turns wall painter, motorcycle rider, sailboat sailor, midnight swimmer, rooftop wall sitter (fortunately less than a minute for each activity) with the totally unrealistic and incompetent questioning by Anne the psychiatrist.
(4.) Little effort by the studio to spend money. No realistic special effects and no effort to research plane crashes. The plane's remnants should have been clearly marked and placed in a secure hanger. To save composer and musicians fees the music was a constant and monotonous plunking of a few piano keys. Saved money by not having a director as evidenced by the lack of continuity and building tension appropriate for this type of movie. Well, someone added a gratuitously brief semi-sex scene.
(5.) But the worst crime that the studio commits is to exploit people's fear of flying and death with the feelgood ""you're not really dead just vacationing your dreams forever""."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"I agree with many of all these less-than-impressed reviews of this movie.  I am really getting tired of how todays films depend so much on CGI.  It's just not perfected yet.  It still looks way too cartoonish which is very hard to take seriously.  I miss the sci-fi horror films of the 1980's.  Creating special effects WITHOUT CGI looked more realistic on film back then.

And what's more.  I have yet to see any Will Smith film worth watching twice.  He does ""big budget"" films, but they are generally all pretty lame in appeal.  His ""Wild Wild West"", ""Independence Day"", ""Men in Black"", ""I Robot"", etc.  These are just a few of some pretty lame big box office Hollywood films.

""Hitch"" didn't have any CGI, so I guess what made that film bad was just Will Smith himself.  Well, wait a minute.  It's not that I don't like Will Smith.  I just don't like any of his films.  Any actor could have replaced him in all those films of his, and it will still be an overblown, but still dull movie to me.  I guess I just don't care for his choices in his movie career.  But, I guess he's not hurtin'.  America eats this crap up."

Now they will bring Michionne in, but seriously wt heck is she doing out in the woods with hundreds of zombies around? And old man Herschel with that 100 round pump shotgun was too funny. Rick needs to get serious and give Carl a good ol' fashioned butt-whooping for all the mess he's caused and Lori is a bipolar biatch who needs to be served-up as zombie chow. T-dog -what the heck good is he? He's always wanting to go off on his own, and never does squat. Just kill him-off already. Carol, seriously-- Sophia was more useful. And now that we know everyone's infected already, who cares if you turn into a zombie upon dying and not by being bitten/scratched. Maybe they will introduce a new twist here.

Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"I'm a Huge fan of Will & Grace. I think it is without a doubt one of the best shows on TV. That said this season was about 50/50, and for a show that's previous seasons were 90/10 that doesn't say much. This season for some reason the shows creators decided it was time for Grace to get married. They chose Harry Connick Jr. as her love interest Leo. This decision threw the show completely off the course, and in my eyes changed what the show was about. Two friends.....It became more about Grace getting married, being a newlywed, and trying to deal with a husband that wasn't around quite so much. Karen and Jack remain hilarious as always. Jack continues his career of being a struggleing actor and Karen divorces Stan after discovering he was having an affair with Minnie Driver who was suprisingly HILARIOUS.

The one thing that I will say about this season is that it has some of the funniest episodes of the series. Mainly the season finale which features Karen, Will, Grace, and Jack putting Stan to rest at sea. Without giving away too too much two of the characters go overboard, someone might be cheating, and two characters end up in bed together. By far one of the funniest episodes EVER!

Good show, and just a ok season.....Still worth the buy!"
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"Having just watched McFarland USA with Costner which I think was a good movie, it was tough for me not to compare the two movies and Costners portrayals a bit. Costners plays his flawed character well although his portrayal feels a bit more subdued than I expected. To me though Estill, who played the little girl Eloise, really played her role well. This is a movie that tries to tell a story that is a shade of gray and not clear cut with everyone involved having some character flaws of their own. There are some emotional moments but at times the movie feels a bit flat and slow moving and the story failed to really connect me to the characters and pull me at the heartstrings that I expected it to do so. It almost seemed to me that they tried too hard to be a bit grey in their story at times with the lack of character development that made it feel a bit superficial. Maybe it was because I watched McFarland USA and I am comparing this too much, I don't know. This is not a bad movie by any means as it is a good family movie that can start a conversation but it does seem to lack something that could make it more. 3 to 3."

Saw the film in its original theatrical run, was ready to leave the Uptown Theater in D.C. but realized Carol Burnett still had more to do, so I stayed.  Been reading the reviews here and don't understand the business about the aspect ratio.  If the reviewers had only the DVD version and not the Blu-ray, then maybe so.  This is what the High Def Digest review says regarding that:
30 years can show a lot of age on some movies but Annie is a breath of fresh air for a catalog title. The films 2.40:1 framed production design and muted color scheme shines bright and clear with a beautiful restoration. The picture maintains a wonderful film-like appearance with a solid grain structure that maintains depth and detail without compromising black levels. There is slight softness in the overall image, but Id wager that is by intention as fine detail doesnt suffer. For a musical it offers a lot for the eyes to see and enjoy.  Would love to hear comments/clarifications on this."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"The best thing about this DVD: a chance to be introduced to some of most wonderful music beyond the standard repertory.  As someone forever seeking something I haven't heard before, this score was something of a revelation.  And this is greatly to the credit of William Christie, and his superb group of singers (Piau, Naouri, d'Oustrac, Piolino, Lehtipuu) who were fully engaged and demonstrated that there is much fine singing beyond the Three Tenors world.

However: the staging is just soooo tiresome!  It starts off amusingly with white projections that end up built up like a three tier cake with dancers and singers coming and going through them.  Unfortunately then you realize that's all it's going to happen, with singers mainly in the forefront while all the dancing and projections are going on in the background non stop.  I'm sure in the theater this might have been very distracting.  On video at least the camera can focus mainly on the singers and ignore most of the extraneous business during their arias.

If you curious of the music you should seriously explore the music on CDs; however if this is your only option, view a borrowed copy to make sure you know what you're getting.  It ain't cheap.  Were it not for the wonderful music, I would have tossed it out long ago."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"This movie got SMACKED TO THE HILT by the critics - usually a sign that a movie is good.

In fact, it is not an 'amazing' movie - don't expect a masterpiece - but it is not bad by any way of measurement. Of-course, the flim 'deals' with the stereotype of working mothers, but before you write it off as predictable feminism the character Kate Reddy (played by Sarah you know who) comes across as a genuine, nice person. Even though Kate has an up-market jobs, a lot of the problems she faces are universal - lack of time to spend with kids, boss calling you in to work when you thought you had a special night with the partner, jealous colleagues and the like.

Unfortunately, her friend Allison is trotted out to give the hard-line men-hate-us mantra now and then, and the film tries to mock stay-at-home mothers; as if stereotyping stay-at-home mothers will 'break' the working-mother stereotype. But they recover that with good interplay between SJP and Pierce Brosnan, as Kate deals with a flirtatious but supportive superior.

You leave this movie feeling sorry for the situation Kate finds herself in, and the plight of the modern working people who are rushing through life, but some of the other characters are a bit one-dimensional and are meant to be demeaning, although it was only ever meant to be comical."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"I was super-excited about the original films being released on Blu-ray......until the news arrived that Lucas was further altering them by adding new dialogue.

While the whole ""NOOOO!"" sequence has been much-ballyhooed by viewers, it did somewhat fit in 'Sith.'  For 'Jedi'.....absolutely not.  The original scene, where Vader quietly watches Palpatine attempt to murder Luke and then has a change of heart, is so much more powerful in that Vader makes his decision in complete SILENCE.  Considering that Anakin is depicted as a hotshot motormouth in the prequels, it makes the silence of the original cut of 'Jedi' so much more powerful.  (And, while I'm at it on 'Jedi', why did Lucas have to change the music at the end?  Totally ruined my childhood memories of watching my battered old VHS.)

Look, Mr. Lucas, as a writer/editor both in career and hobby, I can understand about creating something wonderful and then always wondering how it could have been made better.  Seriously, though.  Please stop.  You created an amazing fictional world that became bigger than anyone could have ever dreamed of.  It is a cultural phenomenon that has forever changed film and the lives of fans.  Why ruin a good thing?

I'm also glad that Kip Pardue has disappeared from film, since his presence was an ink stain on anything he graced.  He is just so dull.  This flick doesn't do him any favors.  Sure, the racing sequences are exciting, but they are all so overdone and glossy that they lose their edge and become preposterous eye-soars.  The remainder of the cast is also a mess.  Estella Warren makes a pretty bland romantic interest.  She's cute enough, but she's also ridiculously dull.  Sylvester Stallone has never been `talented' in this area, and he doesn't bring any of the glimmers of promise he mustered out of that overrated 1976 boxing flick.  Instead, he grumbles through this film as if he was merely tolerating it.  The only shimmer of light comes from a predictably catty Gina Gershon who is always a delight, regardless of the fact that she can't seem to play more than one shade of character.  In the end, this tiresome bore is far from worth the price of admission.  This is easily one of the worst films 2001 had to offer, and that's saying a lot considering that the year also birthed such travesties as `Glitter', `Jurassic Park III', `Swordfish' and `The One'."

The X-Division title match between RVD & Kenny King was a bit sloppy at times, but a fine TV style match but again unfortunately this is PPV. The World Tag Team title match between Chavo Guerrero & Hernandez against Joey Ryan & Matt Morgan was More of the same, not bad, a bit sloppy at times, but more of a TV style match than a PPV match. See a pattern here? The Bully Ray-Austin Aries match was a Good match even with the bad finish. The Knocksout title match between Tara & Mickie James was pretty good match even if we did see too much Jesse. The 8 man tag team match between Kurt Angle, Samoa Joe, Garett Bischoff and Wes Briscoe against Four Members of Aces and 8s (Doc, Devon, Masked Man and Masked Man) was another solid, but unspectacular match. The AJ Styles-Christopher Daniels match was a really good match, but the crowd did it no favors, which is a shame and the story of the night. The World title match between Jeff Hardy & Bobby Roode was another good match that was hurt by the crowd. I give this PPV a 5 out of 10."

The other 2 movies were pretty funny throughout the whole movie and this one has hits and misses. There were parts i was laughing till i almost cried and other parts that were not funny at all. This one has more parodys of sci fi movies mainly and 8 mile. The last 2 focused more on horror. Here they parody the movie signs , the ring and 8 mile. The last 2 films had more movie parodys of all diffrent horror films and this film has popular culture parodys and sci fi. If your a fan of the first two , get this one to complete the trilogy and if you havnt seen the others or just thought they were so so rent this. Youll get a couple good laughs. Also i don't agree with the reviews that say the only funny parts are in the movie commercials they showed. All the funny parts i saw were not in the commercials and the one from the commercial ( the Micheal Jackson part) wasn't that funny and that wasn't really Micheal Jackson, it was a micheal jackson imitator.

He has every right to be angry,he has lung cancer and hates what is happening to his neighbourhood. a gang of thugs so vicious even the police are afraid of them  have taken over and rape,steal kill and destroy whenever they feel like it. The only who cares beside Walt is a pudgy, young priest who has no idea what he is doing.
So Walt starts taken care of things on his own,he also helps a wimpy kid get it together so he can make it in the world.

Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"When I saw this DVD I thought it might be good with Penn directing and the cast, but now I can see why I do not recall seeing its trailer at a theatre or on my tv screen....
The dialogue is badly muddled some of the time.....e.g. when Frank and Joe are alone on the porch of their old farm and running around in the corn field......Another instance is when Joe goes to the bar to see why Frank is not at home where his child is being born.
There is also a tendency to leave things hanging.....
I found it a waste of some talented actors e.g. Bronson, Hopper, Denis and others, but admit that it is probably the best thing that Morse has ever done on the big screen...normally he walks thru his roles like a zombie.
I found Mortensen's character, Frank, to be sad and compelling, but the others were fleeting in time and depth.
Finally, are we to believe that after Frank beats the bartender to death, that his brother, a dedicated police officer, just sighs and tells us that he never saw him again? He is of course not aware of the other things he has done before he hit town but this is a problem that does not deserve a slap on the wrist and a sad farewell, no matter if he is his brother or not.

Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"Hell Town, 1937 film

It starts with a cattle drive of Herefords (not the longhorn cattle of the mid-19th century). Men ride up shooting pistols to turn the herd. Horses are also driven. Three men make a stand by trees. The rustlers drive off the cattle. In town there is action at ""The Casino"". Tom gives $100 to his cousin and his friend, but this is refused. Bart Hammond owns the saloon and talks to his associates. He talks to two men and offers them a job as cooks. A rattlesnake causes a horse to run off until Miss Judy is rescued. Cattle will be driven to the railroad by Dave. Will the rustlers try again? Yes, when there are only two guards.

The cattle arrive in town to be loaded on the railroad for shipment. The cowboys want to celebrate in town. Will Dave play poker? The waiter switches a deck of cards! This lets the professional player win. [A lesson for the audience.] Tom explains his actions to Miss Judy. In town Tom sits in at the poker game and discovers the cold deck! There is a shot, Tom rides off with the money. The gamblers chase them. Will help come in time? Yes. Dave and his partner return to Montana.

Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"Positives:
Great acting performances by Pippi and her penguins. Mostly good by everyone else except Carrey and Lansbury, at times, reverted to their stereotypic past learned phrasings and characterizations.
Enough uniquely humorous lines and skits to make the movie a mostly novel laughable experience. So, kudos to the writers for those parts.

Negatives:
Studios with their crew of writers, directors and producers know that making money takes precedence over creativity so with that thought in mind we have the following too predictable scenes:
A stereotypic plot framework of a newly divorced couple with teens.
Teens have their own issues as well as navigating/mediating the divorce.
Dad, as usual, had his own father family issues growing up.
Dad is seen as more in love with his monied vocational interests than the kids.
Mom, has a new male friend that ends up to be a boor. Yes, gets booted.
At stake is a prize piece of property that is predictably going to be procured by Dad after he re-prioritizes with the help of, guess who, penguins.
Dad also wins kids and wife after he re-prioritizes with the help of, guess who, penguins.
Penguins, at first, were presented in a clever way but towards the end the writers ran out of ideas and the animals just did the same made-up cute tricks found in most animal movies.

In summary, if the movie just had Pipi and the penguins to build around it would have had the potential to be creatively - spot on."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"Death of Klinghoffer may or may not be a good opera.  It may or may not inappropriately glorify the Palestinian cause.  But, from this production, we'll never know.
First, it is a film based on the opera, NOT a film of the opera.  Something like one-half of the running time is devoted to videos of imagined (on the part of the director) action while the opera score serves as mere soundtrack.  What this might have looked like on the stage is entirely lost.  Alice Goodman is a subtle poet -- I doubt that she intended her libretto to be illustrated by such ham-handed visuals as this film employs.
Second, and much worse, is the awful background noise that overlays much of the music.  We hear shouting, gunfire, rocks hitting walls, and so on, during much of the time the chorus is singing, and even sometimes when the principals are singing.  On occasion this background noise drowns out the opera itself.  It is absolutely infuriating -- one wants to hear John Adams' music, not Ms. Eurotrash's background chatter.  It looks like the director simply uses this score as throwaway background music for a political film.
This is one of the few opera DVDs that I would not recommend that anyone acquire.  And it's really too bad -- we need more DVD recordings of good modern operas such as those of Adams."

Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"I had high expectations of this miniseries, given it's creation under the auspices and consultancy of Mr. King himself.  It turned out to be a drawn out melodrama, full of gimmickry and with very little of the artistic panache of the original movie.  The hotel itself was attractive enough, but from there on, it went downhill.  Neither the malevolent, carnivorous topiaries in the garden, nor the two lame ghost plot participants did much to create a haunted atmosphere in the hotel.  The hotel's creaks and groans and auto-swinging doors were trite and none of the characters were truly convincing.  Rebecca de Mornay as Wendy is alright, Jack Torrance, played here by Steven Weber is an annoying exercise in waffling, being an aggressive boozer one minute, and a pathetic whimperer the next.  He never seems to be able to make up his mind who he is or what he wants,  an irritatingly disjointed character who himself seems to have no idea where he is going.  Consequently, the whole thing is ultimately a three hour bore. While the original movie may have had it's shortcomings in its abrupt structure of the progression of the story, it was nevertheless far more convincing than this mushy rendition which seemed to be nothing more than the product of the mercantile minds at Warner Brothers, doing their level best to wrest additional revenue from a classic story."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"I'm not a purist, I thought where LOTR deviated from the book it was done to good effect and often brought in material and character background from Tolkien's own notes.

The Hobbit movie does not have the same reverence for the source material.  Clearly the makers thought the book story was too boring for modern viewers so they turned it into an action-and-adventure movie with no subtlety or sense of discovery.  Orcs are brought in much earlier in the story to tack on fight scenes and drive the party (rather than boring old cold and hunger).  Computer animated scenes and cutesie additional characters are thrown in to market to kids.  The action in the stone giants scene is right out of Transformers and the orc dungeons are shown as vast Moria-like caverns to allow gratuitous animated tracking shots.

The beginning of the Gollum scene was the end of the movie for me.  Instead of Gollum creeping out of the gloom, he is introduced in a made-up action scene and the ring pops out of his pocket in a flash of animated effects so no one can miss it.

If I was a purist I'd give it one or two stars but if you take it as a standalone action movie and not an adaptation of a great book it's not bad.  So I'm giving it a 3.  Just don't expect the experience you had with LOTR."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"For SyFy, this isn't worse than anyother tripe they put out. It's got Ving Rhames and Lesley-Ann Brandt is pretty kickass. With one exception, the cast is actually pretty good. Which leads us to-Taryn Manning. She has to be the WORST actress in the history of zombie films. She can't act her way out of a paperbag. Her character, Romona was also the most useless character I have ever seen in a movie. She gives ""too stupid to live"" a whole new meaning. Her friend is being murdered, what does she do? RUN AWAY and yell at everyone else because they didn't save him! The special effects are sub-par, but I kind of expected that. There were a few major errors that would have been cheap and made things look more realistic, but they producers were obviously too lazy to figure out. For instance Henry kills a zombie with a chainsaw, then right after he stands there holding the chainsaw and you can clearly see THERE IS NO CHAIN on it! How hard would have been to use a fake prop chain or put a chain on after the ""kill"". The film moves along fine until the end and SPOILER alert: there are not one but TWO freaky, fake as f@!& looking zombie tigers at the dock. It was like they didn't know how to end the movie, so they just started throwing crap out there to see what would stick."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"I have other ""drive-in"" tapes from Madacy and am quite happy with them. TRACK OF THE VAMPIRE sounded intriguing, and the price was right. I was all set to lambast this film, until I read the other reviews and was informed that there was footage missing. I love 50's trash horror, bad acting, etc. , but I wasn't prepared to be as bored as I was. I guess I don't equate bad acting with sleepwalking. And what was with that overlong deal with the dancer on the beach? Suddenly, it was over. On came a Betty Boop cartoon. I thought OH JOY! The cartoon wasn't even that good, though Ms. Boop showed maximum cleavage and overt sexiness, apparently before she ran into trouble with the Hayes code (1932). Surprise! The second film, NIGHTMARE CASTLE was blessedly interesting. Directed by Allan Gruenewald (real name: Mario Caiano) and starring the wonderfully confident Barbara Steele, we have here a film of great style, if not substance. Though poorly dubbed, fans of this genre don't really care. I didn't. Lotsa schlock & silly stuff entertained. Upon further investigation, I was interested to find out that TRACK was actually pasted together with footage from a Yugoslavian film and originally released by AIP as BLOOD BATH. Forget this version of TRACK, but CASTLE is definitely worth a look. Quality of print is also questionable. Madacy did a much better job with BLOOD CREATURE/WEREWOLF IN A GIRLS' DORMITORY."

This review is of how Sony Pictures Home Entertainment has ignored our greatest war hero and not of the poor quality of this offering. This release is not one of Columbia Pictures/SPHE's. Our greatest war hero's memory deserves better treatment. I will purchase this DVD when Sony remasters it for DVD release. Even better, Sony should remaster Audie Murphy's remaining movies not yet released on DVD onto a series of Blu-Ray collections befitting a man of his stature. Randolph Scott deserves the same multiple Blu-Ray collections of his many westerns he starred in. C'mon Sony, start mining those golden nuggets in your vaults, polish them up (remaster) and release them in standard DVD and Blu-Ray to protect them for posterity and to give us western movie collectors something worth buying. I buy 20 western DVDs and Blu-Rays to 1 modern movie today because they knew good story telling back in the day and morals of right and wrong were reinforced with their telling. Today, we have many people wondering through life without a moral compass. But, I digress. Please give Audie and Randolph the respect they deserve and do it right!

Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"I had fun watching ""Bad Teacher."" It's not a great film by any means, and I don't plan on repeated viewings, but it was enjoyable to watch once.

What's interesting about the film is that it's about a character that is completely morally reprehensible, and yet still comes across as likable. Much of this probably has to do with Cameron Diaz, who is just such a likable actress. She's a beautiful woman with a knockout figure and a mega-watt smile, and yet she's so goofy and willing to make fun of herself that even when she's playing nasty characters it's hard not to find her charming.

And boy is this character nasty. She's greedy, she's lazy, and she's selfish. She lies, she steals, she manipulates. What's also interesting is that the storyline of the repugnant central character, Elizabeth, does not fall into either of the two clichs that you'd expect from a Hollywood film:

1) She does not end up finding herself inspired by the children and discover a love of teaching, revealing a heart of gold hidden beneath her prickly exterior.

2) She does not find herself getting her comeuppance for being such an awful human being.

If anything, the characters in the film who are depicted as truly pathetic are Elizabeth's sincere, hardworking fellow teachers. Is this a dubious message? Perhaps. But the performers are all so funny and likable (Lucy Punch and Justin Timberlake are both hilarious) that they manage to make up for the film's many flaws."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"This movie is unfortunately different from the book as others have detailed.  For myself, I found that key Christian symbolism (the purpose of these stories) was removed, and in its place is far too much emphasis on a statement from Aslan that things never happen the same way twice.  Beyond having no great meaning, ironically, the scene occurs twice, with Aslan saying the same thing twice about things not happening the same way twice.  Worthless.  Where is the emphasis on Nikabrik's disbelief in the Narnians' tales of a savior, and where is the emphasis on the faith of Caspian, Cornelius, and Trufflehunter in a savior that lived many years ago who not only died but lived again and will return?  Their dialogue should have been the highlight of the film as it was for me in the book.

Incidentally, who else hated the repeated nauseating Reepicheep jokes?  ""You're a mouse!!""  Ugh.  They ruined such a great character.  But there are too many complaints about this film to list them all.

I intend to own the version of The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe from the same series.  I was so pleased with its faithfulness to the novel, and I looked forward to seeing the other books adapted. However, despite the good things they did in Prince Caspian, overall it was too disappointing to watch again, and I have no desire to watch The Voyage of the Dawn Treader."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"The single DVD version with the concept of the ""probes"" being sent from a future human race was a very upbeat and inovative plot device for this vision of Earth-after-man. That is what we all saw on the Animal Planet version of this show. Each of the ages was treated the same in the full length episodes as they were in the introductery condenced one hour form. They added probes and the omnipresent narrarator to guide us through each hour. I was enthralled with the whole weird thing! Completely swept away!
So,when I got this collection of British talking heads beaming at how smart they all were to have theorised all these creatures out of nothing but thin air-headedness,I was disenchanted at best. They all came off as arrogant and way too self satisfied. While listening you could hear the flaws in many of the basic assumtions. The ecologies and behaiviors shown were often far too over simplified to create their ""new possibilities"". As a viewer your suspention of disbelief was completely shot! There was no way to invest your imagination in these soap bubble epocs being constantly reminded that they are just creations.
Obviously,I am in the minority here and I'm shouting ""FIRE"" long after the smoke has cooled. So be it. This is one of the very few times that the more intellectual cut was all wrong. The US versions were much better films in every way; repeat footage and all. You were viewing events,not ideas. It might have sold better too."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"McQuarrie is clearly a movie junkie.  This is evident by his Peckinpah-esque story arc and settings and his pair of anti-heroes; the John Woo-esque excessive gunplay, the subsequent and frequent showers of bullets, and the limitless supply of people to kill, and guns to kill them with; and the Quentin Tarantino-esque self-conscious subversion of the genre.  I didn't mind all his overt nods/homages/rip-offs (whatever) because it still made for a heady mix that was fun, albeit a little too violent for my tastes.  Even the slow, slow-speed car chase, the failed-but-then-successful kidnapping attempt, and the cell-phone bit were fun although it's clear that McQuarrie is too conscious of the trademarks/cliches set down by his predecessors and is trying his darnedest to put a fresh spin on things.  But what weren't fun for me were the complex turns the plot took about halfway through the film.  Last week, I saw another overplotted film, ""Nurse Betty"", and I forgave the turns in that plot because LaBute dutifully made sure each of them paid off (although not all of them worked).  Here, the complications get piled on top of one another for no reason, and some are left to dangle without ever being resolved or even referred to again.  In McQuarrie's defence, I did get the feeling that many of the needless plot devices were meant to set up that final line of dialogue.  But even if that's the case, it's still not worth it because it wasn't THAT funny."

Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"This documentary is in my opinion a valuable expose of the credit card industry's ""back room"" techniques to get us consumers in debt and keep us there.  It shows the methods credit collection agencies use to get people to pay, and how those who are the least able to support a lot of debt in their lives are the most profitable people for credit card companies to get hooked into going into dept.  I learned a lot, and I think most anyone would benefit from seeing this documentary.

The two problems I had with this documentary were as follows:

First, it seems that all the average people (bankrupt or near-bankrupt consumers) interviewed in this film were portrayed as victims of the credit card industry, with no question as to how responsible or irresponsible these people might have been.  The bottom line is that credit card companies make people poor, keep them poor, and of course President Bush played right into their hands by championing the recently passed revisions to US bankruptcy laws.

The second problem I had was that although there is no narration, there are black slides with white text, and for some reason the editors picked a very hard to read font design and used it to create tiny paragraphs in the middle of a mostly black screen.  Not only that, the slides aren't up there very long, so be ready to hit the pause button on your remote so you can read the narration.

So, this documentary is worth a watch, if the price is right."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"Beneath The Twelve Mile Reef was the second or third Cinemascope movie. Cinemascope format was like IMAX format turned on its side - it was wide, rather than tall. Cinemascope movies were in color, and most movies were not in color in 1953. Scenes were typically breathtaking; actors were beautiful or handsome as appropriate. With all that, plot and acting were frequently deficient. BTTMR has more or less adequate acting, its scenes were originally beautiful, and its actors appealed to audiences of the day. That was enough to get it by.

The movie fell into the public domain a while back. Many grainy copies emerged. Also, televisions could not adequately frame the Cinemascope format, so copies were abbreviated laterally. As a result, all the elements that originally sold this movie were neutralized. The version I purchased on Amazon VOD was unforgivably poor, and of course the deficient plot remains. Indeed, the writing is less forgivable than the appearance.

At some point, it seemed to me that I had been watching this turkey for an awfully long time so I checked to see how much more I had to endure. The ROKU told me four minutes. Hmmm. Four minutes. Problem was the movie still had a half dozen plot lines unresolved. I continued the movie.

In four minutes, the bad guys showed up, there was a fight, then everybody kissed and made up, the meanest bad guy happily gave his girl to the youngest good guy, and the credits rolled. Four minutes. (Did I mention?)

That's... really... bad script writing! You almost have to admire it!"
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"I wasn't bothered by ""Extremely Dangerous'"" obvious borrowing of a central premise from ""The Fugitive."" It was the lack of suspense and surprises that got to me. I expected a thrill ride of a movie, but it never materialized over the long 3-hour 20-minute DVD.

Obviously, the script is the greatest weakness here. In terms of suspense or mystery, it is a total flop. None of the clues amount to much, you can see the supposed plot twists a mile away, and the villains are easy to spot.

The worst part was how the scriptwriter got the protagonist out of scrapes -- much like an old-time serial, there is even a scene where he dives into the water and is surrounded, seemingly without escape. Then, fade out. Fade in to Sean Bean back at his apartment. How he managed to escape is never shown or explained!

What I assume was the lack of much of a budget seems evident by other odd choices. In one scene, a skyscraper is said to be burning to the ground, but instead of seeing any part of it, we're told about it (with the sound effect of sirens in the background). A low budget is not always a liability, if it spurs creativity, which was not the case here.

What might have made this bearable -- an interesting main performance -- is not forthcoming from Bean. He exhibits no range or subtlety. That leaves the interesting bits to supporting actors -- in particular, Nitin Ganatra as a Pakistani cab service operator. His scenes crackle, but little else in the movie does."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"3 stars is a little harsh - but I only gave the Royal Albert Hall one 4 stars and I liked it better than this, so I've got to go one less.  Why?  Like on RAH, the guests were a total distraction.  Unlike some reviewers here, I really do not care for Ms Hart's vocal stylings.  My negative reaction to her is nearly as strong as my deep disappointment with Glenn Hughes & the BCC sound.  Hiatt and Rodgers were like the guests on RAH - old greats that just don't hold a candle anymore to the stratospheric Mr Bonamassa.

Fortunately, it's a nice full program and so you can skip past the guests and still feel like you got your money's worth.  Joe and the boys are really very good - worthy of the many 5 star reviews here.  Bergman is the only lineup change from the group I saw perform live - and a fine addition.  I especially liked Blue and Evil, since that was the highlight for me on Black Rock.  I was delighted that Joe dug into the old catalogue and pulled out The River, because I missed him playing that one when I saw him.

But that tees up my recommendation.  RAH is better than this for the musical selections but the DVD you should really get is the old Rockpalast one.  Joe really shines in that more intimate club setting and you can see why he deserved the recognition that enabled him to move on and play the grande venues."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"If you don't recoil from the idea of a school teacher in charge of your children's education who smokes dope, lies, steals, manipulates those around her, uses movies to babysit her class while she sleeps off a hangover every morning and is totally devoid of any sense of professional responsibility to her students, then maybe you'll find this film funny.

The overriding conceit at the heart of `Bad Teacher' is the idea that the audience will somehow look past the reprehensible moral bankruptcy at the core of the central character (played to perfection by Cameron Diaz) and root for her, because she's good looking and has a few memorable one-liners so all can be forgiven. The character Diaz plays so well is dishonest, greedy, lazy, irresponsible, rude, utterly self-serving and in every way despicable. She is educating your kids, folks, and her manipulative, blackmailing ways win out for her in the end. This is funny, OK?

The film gets two stars rather than one because, on a purely technical level, it works as a (very improbable) narrative. The storyline is coherent and the editing snappy, the actors give their all, the script does have its moments, it's watchable. But somehow it's hard to get past the overall message the film leaves you with: if you're a selfish, lying, morally bankrupt, pot-smoking, drunken, money-grubbing whore willing to blackmail and deceive all around you whilst having complete contempt for any kind of professional responsibility to your students and their futures, this is in some way admirable. You will win out over more honest and responsible people, and it's hilarious.

Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"This is perhaps my least favorite collection of Sansone workouts. Along with a handful of old LS tapes, I have Leslie's '5-Day Fit Walk'....which I really like....and 'Ultimate Collection' (yet to do all the routines).

'Muscle Mile One' is your basic one mile. '30 Minute Walk' (also on '5-Day Fit Walk') is good. When I need a fairly gentle workout and want a cast of very real people (not Leslie's fellow instructors or a group of the familiar faces) 'Walk Diet One Mile' suffices (no production value here). 'Walk Strong Express' is my fave on this DVD. Challenging and makes for a nice change with the interval training (and the participants using different kinds of weights).

In search of variety and options beyond the basic four LS moves I was interested in 'You Can Do Pilates.' I'm not familiar with her solo offering by the same name, which has a slightly longer run time, so it may afford more in the way of instruction. Were it not for the fact I have some knowledge of Pilates this would be way too confusing. It lacks detailed breathing and body positioning cues, and, in my opinion, presumes the participant has an intermediate skill level.(As a Boomer, my Pilates faves are Carol Argo's 'Anti-Aging Method' and Maggie Rhoades' 'Pilates Complete for Inflexible People.')

As with some of the other 'collections' the music of these older workouts....upon which I rely to keep me moving and in sync with the workout...is weak much of the time. The sound quality from one workout to another lacks consistency, as well. Given my other LS workout options, this one is rarely in the rotation."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"Review of Secondhand Lions
Hot Toasty Rag, November 29, 2017

Usually, in this formula of coming-of-age films, its a troubled young girl who gets sent to her grandmothers house, ultimately learns the errors of her ways, and becomes a better person. In Secondhand Lions, Haley Joel Osment gets sent to his great-uncles farm. This type of squeaky-clean, goody-goody story is usually watched by women, which is why they usually star women. The added testosterone of three men in the lead roles made the film feel a little strange. Tim McCanliess script tried to add a masculine plot line about finding a hidden stash of gold, but it was a storyline that didn't really appeal to women. All in all, the film doesnt really work.

Michael Caine and Robert Duvall play Haleys great-uncles, and the real problem with the film is spoken by the latters character. He says, in teaching a life lesson to his nephew, that he believes all people are genuinely good. The reason this line of dialogue doesnt resonate is the same reason the rest of the film doesnt work: its not speaking to the right audience. If a grandmother character said that line to her granddaughter, the women in the audience would feel warm and fuzzy inside and the movie would have been a hit. Women, especially in this genre of films, have a special close-knit circle of girl power that would make that line believable. Men face disappointments as soon as they are old enough to chase after their dreams; they live through daily struggles, internal frustrations, and never-ending regrets. I cant imagine a man of Robert Duvalls age truly believing that all people are good."

A bunch of adults discover just how frightening the wrong kind of clown can be in this horror opus. After the girl he loves is stolen away by a thuggish gang member, a young man uses the forces of evil to bring to life Killjoy (Angel Vargas), a clown doll he owned as a child. The young man is killed before the spell can fully take effect, but Killjoy soon comes to life to wreak a horrible revenge on the people who killed his master.

Review - 2/5
When I seen how low IMDB had Killjoy rated I just had to watch it. Was it really that terrible? Well I've seen much, much worse. Yeah the characters are bad and the whole cast is virtually unknown. The camera work is amateurish and cheap. But it does have it's moments that made me laugh at times. The evil clown seems like Micheal Jackson dressed up in a costume. He has some funny one liners and would have been scarier if not for the corny script. The effects aren't the greatest but for how cheaply it was made for they do ok. This film pretty much destroyed the chance of any of the actors or director ever becoming a big name. None of them has made anything of note since. Some of them haven't even acted since. Sorry but this clown in the hood type film just didn't work. It's funny for a one time watch but that's about it. I am relectant to watch the other Killjoy films but I'm sure it can't get any worse. Oh yeah, some hot black girls show some skin at least ;)."

The only thing this series succeeds in is putting a whole new meaning in the phrase ""love hurts."" Most of it involves Keitaro getting into embarrassing incidents with these women and getting the crap kicked out him. This happens in just about EVERY SINGLE FREAKIN' EPISODE. It gets old in no time and is just discouraging to me as a viewer. Worse still, there's nary a sympathetic character, much less one the audience REALLY cares about. I practically detested the female characters, especially Keitaro's intended sweetheart, the nasty, overly violent Naru, who comes across as one of the most intolerable, bitchiest, bad-tempered heroines ever committed to Anime. (Yes, she's as bad as the title character from NADIA: THE SECRET OF BLUE WATER in the infamous island/Africa arc and Asuka in EVANGELION.) There are occasional bits of cleverness (like a parody of the popular JRPG DRAGON QUEST), but LOVE HINA's overall nature is too mean-spirited for its own entertainment value. Even if the idea was to make this a comedy, it still falls flat. You'd have to be a masochist in order to sit through this joyless show. Matters are not helped by the dubbing, with performances that range from shrill to just plain awful, a disappointing misfire from the usually capable Bang Zoom studios. All in all, I absolutely detested LOVE HINA and I cannot recommend it. There are far better Anime shows to invest in."

Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"Reykjavik, Iceland Film Festival, September, 2000.
I was not sure what to expect from this. I am a longtime fan and student of all things Yugoslavian. I had seen Makavejev's comparatively commercial film A Night of Love prior to screening two of his more obscure films, Sweet Movie, which is nothing less than visually frightening and decidedly disturbing, and this, Mysteries of an Organism. With more disturbing visual imagery and borrowings from surreal fantasy, the second half of the film is more like a ""film"" in that it tells a story of a Yugoslav woman, who, like all women portrayed in the film, is very sexually liberated, and claims that this is so because all women have been justly liberated by the revolution and socialism in Yugoslavia. When she meets a visiting Russian figure skater, she realizes that the Soviet ideals of socialism are limiting and lead only to repression of the self. She tries to teach him that love and socialism are not at odds with each other, but are indeed intertwined. When they finally make love, he ends up killing her because his passions and love have been so repressed. The first half of the film, which is a bit excessive and strange, is more documentary in style, but it does illustrate the points that are made more eloquently in the second half of the film by probing the life of a man (whose name i cannot recall) who was demonised by the US government.
The screening in Reykjavik was luckily accompanied by the director himself explaining his ideas and what he hoped to accomplish. This is a fascinating film, a total departure from American, or really, any other films of any genre or nationality."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"Only a portion of this film is devoted to the actual rendition of the Water Music, and only a bit of the portion at that. The greater part is focused on the preparations for producing this would-be recreation of the original performance, intended to enhance George I's public relations battle with his son, the eventual successor as George II. The English Concert under Andrew Manze is recruited for the original instrument performance, and they are decked out in period costume -- with the women orchestra members in effect posing as men and the men who have facial hair sacrificing that to the barber's blade for the sake of authenticity. Acoustical tests are performed on the river to gauge how everything will sound outside the concert hall, and a suitable barge reminiscent of those of three hundred years ago must be found to refurbish. In the end, everything comes off, more or less. To call it a full recreation is a bit of an exaggeration, however. The barge must be towed by a modern tug, rather than propelling itself by means of oarsmen. Moreover, the musical barge is more or less on its own, unlike the original performance, where many personal barges accompanied the king to Chelsea for his meal and then back, serenaded all the while. Indeed, as the barge proceeds along the Thames and into the night, few people on shore appear to really notice what's going on. The performances that are heard are certainly fine enough, and the sight of the musicians playing in early 18th Century garb is fun, but in the end I thought the documentary fell just a little flat. Interesting and worth a watch, but not a huge thrill."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"There are two things that might be of interest to some viewers. One is that director of ""Solstice"" is Daniel Myrick, who co-directed a hugely successful horror ""The Blair Witch Project"" in 1999 (with Eduardo Snchez). The other is his latest film stars Shawn Ashmore (""Iceman"" of the ""X-Men"" franchise) and Amanda Seyfried (a young bride-to-be in ""Mamma Mia!""). As a horror film, however, ""Solstice"" offers little more than familiar scares and ineffective narrative despite its stars, beautifully shot photography and some intriguing narrative elements.

""Solstice"" follows the story of Megan (Elisabeth Harnois) trying to recover from one shocking incident that happened to her family, and her friends Christian, Zoe, Mark and Alicia. They travel to a quiet lake house for their annual summer trip, where Megan starts experiencing strange things, like seeing things. Megan comes to believe that some supernatural presence is trying to contact her, perhaps her twin sister Sophie, to let Megan know some secrets. Or maybe she is mistaken.

I can't reveal it in detail, but in the second half of the film an interesting development takes place as Megan realizes the truth about the weird images she continues to see. But the film's slow-paced earlier part is boring with clichd devices such as moving shadows and a ""creepy"" old guy (R. Lee Ermey). In the end of the film everything is explained and some of the characters, including R. Lee Ermey's ""Leonard,"" show unexpected sides, but it takes too long (more than 50 minutes) before the film reaches that point.

According to the opening credit, ""Solstice"" is based on a 2003 Danish film ""Midsommer."" Perhaps something is lost in translation. Perhaps not. Whichever it is, I feel there is a better movie buried in here."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"By 2001 the resurgence of slasher movies had fortunately died down and audiences were in the mood for something new. Jeepers Creepers is a return to the old-fashioned monster movies in the style of classic Universal. Those were movies built on suspense and atmosphere rather than gore and multiple kills.

Justin Long and Gina Philips play Darry and Trish, a pair of argumentative siblings who are traveling home through the Florida backwaters for spring break. Along the way they are terrorized by an unseen figure driving a ugly truck. Darry sees the figure dumping what appears to be dead bodies into a pipe by an abandoned church. In a moment of agonizing plot contrivance Darry turns around and heads back to find out what's really going on, unawares that he'll give the villain a taste of his fear, thus making him a marked man.

Victor Salva layers the movie with homosexual and incestuous subtext, while keeping the monster in the dark for the most part, building fear and mystery about him. The Creeper is a great villain and Salva builds an intriguing mythology about him.

The swift running time (the credits roll at the 85 minute mark) prevents things from getting deep or expansive but the sequel builds upon this world and is actually a better movie despite the hate. On its own Jeepers Creepers is an effective but superficial. Plenty of points for being original however.

The Blu-ray is in 1.85:1 1080p and it is an improvement on the DVD, however there are just a few too many scenes shot in soft focus which don't give it much of a pop. The black levels are impressive though. It sounds better in DTS HD-MA, and all the extras from the DVD have been ported over."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"What a weird little flick. This 62 minute quickie, directed by Jack Hill and Stephanie Rothman, is about as odd an entry as I've seen in this type of movie. It's set in Venice CA. though much of the architecture seems European. It involves an artist who is the descendant of another, centuries earlier, artist who was put to death for witchcraft, though somehow it caused him to turn into a vampire. He now paints women in the throes of death, kills them and dips them in acid.

I understand this was culled from other movies which explains having two directors and why the villain has two separate visages. But those other movies must have been pretty bad as they still only ended up with a 62 minute flick. The black and white cinematography, particularly in the night scenes, is stunning. And the story contains some odd notes. How many movies have you seen that try to fuse art with quantum physics? And one of the scenes is set up as though it were one of Salvidor Dali's paintings. It's a real eye opener. There is some fun jabbing at the sensibilities of artists and some pretty good cheese cake in the form of Lori Saunders in a bikini.

It's cool seeing Sid Haig in his early days but, like much of the rest of the movie, it's just a curiosity. The whole thing doesn't quite hang together. Plus, the villain resides in a church tower his ancestor resided in in the 11th century. Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't believe there was a United States in the 11th century. Still, though, this is a lot of fun and it's short enough and whacked enough to warrant the attention of ardent film fans."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"When Mark Wahlberg openly implies the mistake he made in taking on the role he played in this film, you know there's a serious problem.

M. Night Shyamalan is a man who clearly needs to redeem himself. ""The Sixth Sense"" was remarkable, ""Unbreakable"" was absolutely incredible, and ""Signs"" was consistently engaging. Everything after those three have been total train-wrecks. I absolutely did not like ""The Village,"" and I thought ""Lady In The Water"" was just about the very worst thing I'd ever seen put to film. But ""The Happening?"" Well, let's just say I was less than thrilled.

An unknown airborne virus that drives common everyday people to inexplicably commit suicide. Think of what could be done with an idea like that! So much more could have been explored on this theme, and yet all we're left with is Wahlberg, John Leguizamo and several other ragtag survivors who do nothing but flee from one random spot to another in some lame attempt to outrun a force they can't even see! Sorry, I guess I was just expecting something a bit more substantial! Shyamalan certainly has it within him to deliver far more interesting stories. But what we get with this is something prone to a rare, substandard dud from ""The Twilight Zone.""

All I can say is, I'm glad I only paid one dollar to rent this at a redbox. Even that, I feel, was too much money.

I really do admire and respect the talent M. Night Shyamalan has proven to possess by virtue of his earlier work. But he is in dire need of getting his act together. Three bombs in a row does not bode well for any director's future in the industry.

To any potential viewers, be forewarned. There's not much of anything ""happening"" throughout this entire movie."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"This season is hard to stomach.  The problem: There is far too much hand wringing over ""torture"" and and other liberal causes (saving africans from genocide, profiling of muslims, Gitmo, evil right wing terrorists) it is difficult to watch. It is such an odd take on 24, which has always been about doing what it takes to beat the bad guys and preserving freedom and the American way. You wonder what the writers were thinking (Presumably, we really hate George Bush). There is also an amazing (and not very beleivable) resurrection of a previously dead 24 character, a feat only Jack Bauer could accomplish up until this season. Lots of eye rolling ensues.  24 has always had liberal elements. (All good presidents are black and/or women, all bad corrupt presidents are white men.) But this season really takes it over top. The last straw was near the end of the season ultra left winger Janeane Garafolo, playing an FBI analysts (the evil CTU has been disbanded, presumably for torturing too many people), whines incesantly about how the FBI was ""trampling the constitution""  by ""profiling"" and jack apologizes to her! I nearly barfed. Add then the peaceful innocent muslims who are framed as terrorists by the evil right wingers and well, you get the picture.  They just beat you over the head week after week with every liberal cause you can imagine. And let's not forget the  slow weepy finale that fades to black before resolving many key plot elements. Does Jack die from being exposed to a fatal biological weapon?, Who knows? Does Renee turn into Jack Bauer and kill the villain? Your guess is as good as mine. Ugh. The worst all the 24 seasons.  You probably want to skip this one."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"After watching Hypocrites, it is interesting to me that even in the early years of filmmaking, movies could be extremely complex and thought provoking. Hypocrites is definitely those two things. The writer and director of the film, Lois Weber, uses the characters of a preacher and Truth (portrayed as a naked woman) to reveal the hypocrisy of society. Though Weber's intentions were most likely to speak on morality, it is interesting that she chose to use a fully nude woman throughout the film to draw in an audience that would not have otherwise seen the film. It was also surprising to me that this film would have been viewed by religious audiences with such unapologetic nudity. However, I will say that whatever could be viewed as indecent may have been made up for by the moral of the film. As the preacher succumbs to a dream, he is taken to an earlier time when he first finds Truth. The preacher then goes around aiming to show Truth to people, only to get rejected every time. In each situation, Truth reveals the true character of people to be corrupt. I feel that the overall story of the film was very well written. However, I found it a little bit difficult to get into the film because of the melodramatic style of acting. Because there was no sound in film at the time, the acting seemed to be more expressive and a lot less realistic. If anything made this film difficult to watch, it would be that. Although, overall I enjoyed the film and felt that Weber was successful in presenting her case of morality. I would be interested in seeing what a modern cast and crew could do with the story. I would love to see someone else's spin on it."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"Two big stars in so so film. Barbara stanwyck did some of the great films in hollywood from double indemnity to sorry wrong number,but this is not one of them. As an actress she has the ability to display criminal types and states of viciousness and depravity that traditionally males display and she is very believable. Thye problem is not only that it is a screwball comedy,and proceeds in a kind of unrealistic vein,but it does that,since all comedies have to have a bit of realism to it...anyways the movie is about a rich couple in which a man is jealous of his doctor wife seeing other male patients. The drama here though does not center around the female stanwyck being in a dominant role and subjecting or ordering the man about,she is all too nice and respectable in this film,almost angelic like. The movie dramatises more the scientific type displayed by the doctor as opposed to the male childish type character,one of emotionalism,a mental problem, a type wanting to exterminate.he's like murder inc(an old word for organized crime),insane asylum,gestapo...and the word 'peek a boo' meaning a child like mind...and that's really where the comedy in this film centers around and at films end we have the male character trying to open up to the
outside world,be more realistic and find a job,and thats when his relationship is saved and he emotionally matures,and she quits her medical practice and joins him in his new life. Really a spoof and its ok since the
stars breathe life in film,and its a very learned and has some intelligent ideas and they are played for laughs...but the characters change all too easily and picture perfect like to make it believable...but a fun film about the emotionalist child like mind and the scientific here occupying opposite genders..."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"I'm amazed at how many people love this movie.  I can tell a lot of money was spent to make this movie, and acting was good but the story struck me as overly dramatic and uneven.  I'm glad the library saved me my money on this DVD.  I'll skip viewing the second disc.

Based on J.G. Ballard's novel, I think the late Roger Ebert summed it up nicely when he wrote:

""The movie's general lack of direction leads to what seems like a series of possible endings; having little clear idea of where he was going, Spielberg isn't sure if he has arrived there. The movie's weakness is a lack of a strong narrative pull from beginning to end. The whole central section is basically just episodic daily prison life and the dreams of the boy. Empire of the Sun adds up to a promising idea, a carefully observed production and some interesting performances. But despite the emotional potential in the story, it didn't much move me.""

If you want to know what really happened read this passage from Ballard's autobiography Miracles of Life:  ""For me, the most important consequence of internment was that for the first time in my life I was extremely close to my parents. I slept, ate, dressed and undressed within a few feet of them in the same small room, in many ways like the poorer Chinese families for whom I had felt so sorry in Shanghai. But I revelled in this closeness. Lying in bed at night I could, if I wanted to, reach out and take my mother's hand. I flourished in this intimacy, such a contrast to formal English life.""

A fascinating subject I plan on  reading J.G. Ballard's award-winning novel, the sequel, and his autobiography too but I would recommend skipping the movie."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"I'd never seen this movie and barely even remembered the title, so as I saw some great reviews I was interested to see what I'd missed. And it wasn't much.

This isn't a bad film (though there is some bad stuff in it) but it just doesn't bring anything new to the genre. It's a revenge flick. Jack Elam, Struther Martin and Ernest Borgnine play outlaw brothers who are inept bank robbers. While being chased by Federales after a bungled bank job they happen upon a ranch where they figure to steal fresh horses. They end up killing the owner and raping his wife, played by Raquel Welch. She comes to, buries her husband and swears revenge.

She meets up with Robert Culp, a bounty hunter, and wants him to teach her the way of the gun. He does, reluctantly, and tries to let her know that it's a bad path she's traveling down.

All of this is OK but it's so middle of the road. We've seen it before many times and seen it better. It's directed OK, it's acted OK (accept for Ernest Borgine who is so terrible you wonder how he ever won an Oscar), it's shot OK, the music is OK. It's just OK.

The 3 Stooges routine between the brothers gets tired fast and, as best I could tell, there is absolutely no reason for the mysterious stranger. The kill scenes aren't particularly clever or exciting, and not that much really happens. The way I see it the only reason for making this film was to put a woman in the revenge seat in general and have her played by Raquel Welch in particular, and she just doesn't have the chops to pull it off.

This is an oddity at best. If you're into that sort of thing then have at it. If not......skip it."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"About as witless and not-horrifying as you can get while making a supposed horror film. We meet four wealthy and one not-wealthy Southern college ""students"" who rent a house together for what seems like endless summer, although they're supposedly going to class. After interminable conversations about their pointless lives and activities, you start rooting for some slaughter just to end it all. Many, many buildups to climaxes that don't arrive, and repeated scenes of the ""students"" going into an empty basement with no payoff. And just to get a bottle of wine from a box in the farthest room along. I thought at first, ""OK, it's really a potion, and they'll all see the ghosts and attack each other"" but it was just wine. Then I kept saying, ""Since you're drinking so much, just bring the whole box up!!!"" But that would have been too easy. These are also the most subdued ""college students"" I've ever seen in a movie.
Of course it's fun to mock bad movies, but sheesh, this one messes up everything: A Civil War setup goes nowhere; scenes are brightly lit when it's supposed to be dark; the same mysterious sounds lead to nothing; a haunted student-rented house looks neater than something in Architectural Digest; and conversations mean nothing to the plot. After a few minutes, it's all about characters you wish you could murder yourself...I watched in sheer incredulity until it was over. (Yes, fine, I'm a glutton for punishment.) At one point, the camera even shook--a lot-- when a character got into a car, and not because there was a demon in it. The photography was actually quite good, if too clear and bright, so it seems more advanced than a student film, but comes across as more of a travelogue for Hampton Roads, Va than something calculated to chill your li'l ol' heart."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"Family-oriented comedy ""Zoom"" has the right cast. Tim Allen is a retired, washed-up ex-superhero who is given a mission to train a group of misfit kids with special ability. The trainees are played by Spencer Breslin, Kate Mara, Michael Cassidy and Ryan Newman. The film also has decent production designs, and is supported by the veterans like Rip Torn and Chevy Chase. So far, everything is great. Well, it might not be great exactly, but you can at least expect a decent family picture like ""Sky High.""

However, the film is helmed by a wrong director, Peter Hewitt, whose previous works include first ""Garfield"" movie and ""Thunderpants"" (just in case you haven't seen it, the latter is a one-joke film about a farting boy). For all the charms and the talent of the cast, and the characters' likable nature, those would-be superheroes/heroines becoming transparent or making the body and limbs bigger like rubber ball, have already been done in ""The Incredibles"" or other films of the same genre. With some wit or twists added, those characters would have been more interesting. As it is, they remain just OK with the lazy direction and very familiar sight gags.

The film's weak script, which does not explain convincingly why these kids must be brought together and trained like this, is already a problem. But the saddest thing is, for me, watching Chevy Chase covered with greenish sticky slime coming out of a boy's nose. It's a worse kind of gag than pie-throwing.

I like Tim Allen, but it makes me sad to see his recent films like this and ""The Shaggy Dog."" The film is not as bad as the very low user rating of IMDb suggests and the father-daughter-like relations between him and Ryan Newman is credible, but except that (and cute Ryan Newman) I cannot think of the reason why this film had to be made."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"First let me say that I wish they'd allow us to rate half-star intervals here; I'd have given this another half-star, mostly due to the great lines given to Arye Gross. I never heard of the guy before, but he's hilarious  here in the role of unlikely hero (that also doesn't want to be hero). Reminds me just a little of the Ash character in ""Army of  Darkness"" or the Jack Burton character in ""Big Trouble in Little  China"". It's Arye Gross' performance that raises this film above  mediocrity. Without his character, the movie would be a plain-jane sci-fi  movie with nothing special about it. Except Maryam D'Abo, whose  sexiness could almost carry the whole thing by itself. Mind you, the  character she plays isn't a particularly sexy character, but her subtle  beauty shows through anyway, and between her and Gross, there is always  something worth watching going on. The supporting cast, Jeff Speakman,  etc. , perform quite well also, and the bad guys are convincingly  evil-looking. The production standards are strictly B-movie however. Special effects are okay but not great, and the settings are sort of  cliched. There are several close-up shots of an asteroid that is pretty  obviously a miniature, but it adds a little charm to it that way--kind of  like watching an old sci-fi movie from the 50's. But understand that I  don't think this movie is trying to be anything but a B-movie. All in  all a standard sci-fi movie with great humor sprinkled throughout. I  laughed out loud many times while watching it. It's worth spending money  on, but just don't expect Oscar-winning stuff here. And now I have to go  see what other movies Arye Gross has been in.

Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"There is really only one reason to watch an Andy Warhol production of a Paul Morrissey film starring Joe Dallesandro--and that is the hope that, somewhere along the way, you are going to see Dallesandro naked. A military brat who ran wild, Dallesandro did a number of nude modeling jobs for ""physique"" magazines before he stumbled into Warhol in 1967. Warhol knew a good thing when he saw it, and for the next several years Dallesandro would appear in one Warhol produced film after another, most of them directed by Paul Morrissey. The trouble is that Warhol was a bad producer, Morrissey was a ho-hum director, and Dallesandro is one of the most wooden actors to grace the screen. But whether he's naked, in a three piece suit, or stomping around in a swim suit--well, he just looks so damn good you can't help but watch his every move. Released in 1972, HEAT has the barest plot imagineable. Dallesandro is a former child television star who wanders into a cheap motel that includes a swimming pool, a grotesque landlady, a couple of brothers who do a nightclub act in which they have sex, and a nitwit woman who claims to be a lesbian and whose mother (Sylvia Miles) is a fading star. Pretty soon Dallesandro is getting naked with the landlady and ultimately he gets naked with the fading star--but when she becomes too possessive he walks out. Throw in the occasional reference to SUNSET BLVD and that's pretty much it. The cinematography is dull and so is most of the cast. Miles is loud and shrewish, but she gives the film what little energy it has. Dallesandro, of course, adds his part to the film by looking drop-dead, rough-trade gorgeous. But unless you're hot to see Miles' sagging breasts or Dallesandro's butt and a quick crotch flash, you might want to give HEAT a miss."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"The music is, as expected, brilliant.  The sets and cinematography are magnificient.  Adrien Brody, as usual, puts in an excellent performance---he has probably the most expressive eyes in cinema.  The script is also solid, few dead spots anywhere.
What keeps this from being a *great* film, however, is Roman Polanski's lack of discipline as a director, or apparently the lack of strong producers willing to trim off all the fat---and boy is there ever lots of fat!  At 2-1/2 hours, this film actually felt twice as long as ""Schindler's List"" which is over 3 hours and covers a much wider scope!  It takes forever to depict a few simple scenes (for example, a starving Brody trying to open a can of cucumbers) and characters (such as Brody's family during the Nazi takeover of Warsaw).  I get the impression that Polanski was given this free hand out of ""sensitivity"" rather than artistic good sense, simply because he himself was a Holocaust survivor.
The result is that unlike ""Schindler's List"" this film has almost no recognizable subtext.  It's been promoted as a ""tale of survival"" or ""one man surviving for the sake of his love of his music"" but in actuality it feels more like a very slow documentary.  Brody actually spends very little time onscreen playing the piano...the first 2/3 of the film mainly centers around the hellish life of Polish Jews herded into the Warsaw Ghetto before getting shipped off to concentration camps.  Brody's character seems less of a tenacious survivor than a bumbling, dazed butterfly---saved mainly by one fortuitous turn of events after another rather than any Herculean personal efforts.
Due to the bloated pacing and relatively passive central character, ""The Pianist"" lacks any clear focus and never develops any consistent momentum.  The viewer, like Brody's character, just sits there waiting for it all to end---we WATCH things happpening, but are never made a PART of them."

Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"Wesley Snipes plays an undercover CIA agent in Romania. Pitted against this perpetually angry hero (whose emotions are delivered with bland voice-over) is a sexy and strong-willed Russian beauty played by Silvia Colloca. Snipes must protect Colloca going back to USA from the attacks of the villains of this country, whose motives I'm still trying to figure out.

There is no denying that this is a low-budget action film made in Romania, kind of film you watch for shoot-outs and explosions. To their credits, the stunt persons of the film did a decent job and in one memorable scene a baddie falls out of the window (of the second floor of a house) and falls onto the roof of a van below, hitting his head against it really hard and bouncing like a rubber ball. That is amazing. And don't forget the cat-and-mouse chase scene in the subway where a bald-headed baddie shows one surprising stunt.

But the rest of the film is very dull. ""The Detonator"" uses every clichd element of action genre taken directly from other better films, and throws them into the convoluted narrative in the wrong way. The film attempts to be different with a portrait of a gangster who owns a soccer team and several scenes about soccer games. However, it just doesn't work because of the tepid descriptions of games and banal action sequences mixed with them.

It was in 2004 when we saw the third entry of `The Blade' which was not bad. But now Wesley Snipes seems to have officially joined in the direct-to-video land where Steven Seagal is the king or the Great One. (In fact `The Detonator' is co-produced by Andrew Stevens who is also responsible for such films as ""Half Past Dead"" ""The Foreigner"" and ""Out of Reach."") I'm not saying that all straight-to-video actions are bad - remember Dolph Lundgren who is doing a very good job as star and director. - but as to `The Detonator"" the result is simply disappointing."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"Any single Justice League animated TV episode makes this film look like the Superfriends from the 1970's, and there simply is no excuse.  Animation studios with amazing talent are everywhere, and Marvel certainly has enough cash after successes like the Spiderman and X-Men films.  Though they tried to put in elements from the brilliantly developed characters in the Ultimates comic series, each scene was rushed, giving no time for emotional involvement.  That, combined with chunky animation, leaves you with little ability to suspend your disbelief and really feel for these characters.

The animation of Giant Man's growth was unimpressive, when it should have been imposing and awe striking.  Wasp's growth, having her wings disappear into nothing only after she's fully grown shows a ridiculously poor understanding by the animators and directors of how her power is supposed to work.

Outside of the animation itself are the pacing, directing and editing of this film.  Each segue was hard and roughly paced.  Camera angles were sharp and characters badly proportioned within them-possibly in an attempt to be stylized.  Scenes were poorly framed.  Character dialogue was unrealistically fast and either emotionally shallow or over the top.  The best voice actor in the film was Andre Ware as Nick Fury, but he's had a lot of experience in the DC animated universe, and it's apparent that experience helped him here.

Marvel studios haven't shown an increase in technical or storytelling skill from the Spider Friends, Spiderwoman or original X-Men animated series in any way and it's unfortunate, because with Mark Millar's incredible storytelling and Bryan Hitch's innovative character design, this could have launched a whole new era for Marvel animation.

I even tried to give this a 2 star rating, just for seeing these characters on the screen, but I can't bring myself to do it.  JLU and the DC animated universe have raised the bar on both storytelling and animation quality.

Step up to the plate, Marvel.  Play time's over."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"I thought this was one of the worst films I have ever seen. It was painful to watch this child being bullied by her drunken father. She had no one to go to and had to eat dog food to survive. The scenes where she was having to try to cook her own dog food and gravy dinner, light a stove with a blow torch and within moments it all explodes. She runs for cover and fear, not just from the fire, but the wrath of her father...she hides in a cardboard box. The fire is all around her and one waits for her to be consumed by the smoke and flames. Suddenly her father appears and chases her out. They race through the swamp, she in terror he in a drunken anger. The scenes of all the drunkeness from the men and women and the wildness of the children...I did not find to be anything but painful. The flooding of the Bathtub area was sad and the hundreds of animals drowned was a reminder of how horrific this storm was. How little help was given left me wondering. They tried to give help but the people did not want to leave what they had...I understand that, but I did not find this to be all that great a film. I guess the father taught the daughter how to survive, and as he was dying it was evident he did love her, but it left me wondering about her future. I have been orphaned, abandoned, homeless, and terrified, but I lived in a major city and had three jobs at one time to try to survive. I guess it is a city person trying to understand a backwoods-swamp existence. The hopelessness was not to my liking. This child seemed like a half wild animal running through the swamp, screaming and shouting, and the filth...I just wanted to bath her, dress her in clean clothes and show her there is something better.

After seeing it twice, I agree with much (but not all) of the positive five star reviews. Out of respect for those who READ reviews, I'll not repeat everything that I like about the presentation. I found the goofy oversize earrings, hairdo, and facial hair arrangement of Daniel Vitalis, (described as a ""Wild Food Expert"") distracting. UGH. Ditto for David Wolfe, who had an extremely goofy wild hairdo. On the other hand, Jon Gabriel, described as an ""author and weight loss expert"" was nicely groomed and a good presenter. His story of personal transformation of a fellow of over 400 pounds (whew) to becoming a jock of normal weight was inspiring. Christiane Northrup preserves her rank as one of America's cutest doctors. A really nice looking woman! Presentations by Dr. Mercola, Jason Vale, Kris Carr, Alejandro Junger were fine. It was disappointing to have Jamie Oliver (so popular in the UK) give Baby Cow Growth Fluid a pass with unscientific but popular ideas on milk. None of the presenters had anything (ZILCH) to say about the work of Doctor T. Colin Campbell. Milk does a body bad. It was good to see all presenters take a stand against sugar. They all agreed on the evils of sugar and refined carbohydrates. With all respect to Dr. Northrup, her ""It's not fat that makes you fat - it's sugar"" statement will not pass muster in the community of experts. Recognizing the evils of sugar should NOT be mutually exclusive to recognizing the proven dangers of fat - particularly fat from dead animals - and EXTRACTED fat of ALL kinds.

Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"ABOVE AND BEYOND is a quasi-documentary true life account of the role that Colonel Paul Tibbets played as the pilot of the B-29 Superfortress that dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima in 1945.  From start to finish, the focus is squarely on the pressures placed on Tibbets (Robert Taylor) and on his wife (Eleanor Parker) who must endure many months of separation from him, all the while with her never knowing his true objective.  Taylor plays Tibbets as a basically decent sort who has to confront early on that it will be his finger that will drop a bomb killing tens of thousands of Japanese men, women, and children.  There is a key scene when Tibbets' commanding officer gives him a button to push and tells him that if he pushes it, more than one hundred thousand will perish.  Tibbets responds by pushing it.  This sets the tone of the movie.  Tibbets has to be hard on himself so that the war may end sooner.  He understands a brutal paradox of war--that for thousands of his people to live, an equal number of the enemy must die.  His wife, of course, does not have the luxury of knowing what he knows and her reaction of resentment is eminently understandable.  ABOVE AND BEYOND is not a plot driven film.  It is no more than a straightforward recording of the pressures faced by one good man who knows that some sacrifices must be made to win a war.  And this is the problem with movies like this.  Tibbets and his wife are essentially static characters with no room for growth.  Taylor shows emotion by growing surly.  His wife becomes stressed out.  Yet the war itself seems little more than a backdrop against which one family plays out a series of squabbles.  The tragedy of war films in general is that such squabbles are often an inevitable result of the much greater carnage occurring discretely offscreen."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"I will say it up front, yes this was a film never previously seen in America, maybe it still has not been. It is from the 1970's, and just about outdoes most other genre entries (no pun intended) in terms of the degree of sleaze radiating off the screen.

Another film where you could speed the film up 4-5 times and quite easily follow the plot, what little there is of it.

I found it interesting to study the eyes of the people 'acting' in this film, there is a lot of uneasiness amid the sleaze on show.

It is really a straight porn shoot (and it is without a doubt X-rated) with one or two lesbian scenes which would have been pretty radical for those days (I'm guessing).

To give an indication of the story and plot standard, the short sex scenes which were often threatening to break out into a very laid back orgy, well those X-rated scenes were the actual highlight of the entire mess on show.

It must have cost a fair bit to make, as it is well shot for the era, and whoever was behind the camera had at least some idea of what they were doing.

I cannot comment on the dialogue as I couldn't bear to expose myself to it (it was dubbed anyway I think, which compounds the agony).

And if you are thinking of purchasing this DVD based on the jacket featuring a gorilla obviously rather taken with a diverting buxom blonde, you will be sadly disappointed.

There is a lame sex scene involving the bloke in the gorilla suit, with a young woman who obviously is unhappy, does not want her face caught on film, and raises the possibility whether she was aware of what was going on or even whether she felt under a little duress during that scene.

Which brings me back to the central point, yes, this is sleaze with a capital 'S'; you sort of do get what was advertised, but it is so tame and takes itself seriously by today's 'standards' it is almost quaint."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"The original book may do a better job, but this HBO production takes great license with the facts, to strumpet things up for a public who seem to need the violent and naked, or otherwise they turn the channel to something equally brain-dead.  Factually, there is nobody who can document so much of what's presented here as ""fact"" -- such as Hamilton and the Adam's cousin, screaming for blood, with twisted angry faces, as a Tory tax agent is tarred and feathered. One almost expects Walter Cronkite to step out from the crowd with a microphone, as in the old ""You Are There"" series.  It also appears to be a conscious effort to show the early American revolutionaries were no different from modern anti-global thugs throwing bricks through MacDonald's and Starbuck's windows, and carrying effigies of modern political leaders hanging from ropes while waving the Red Fascist flags.  The legitimacy of early American sentiments for freedom and self-government is thereby eroded and belittled, while modern fanatics are elevated inappropriately.  Or the ""small"" fact that two of the British soldiers at the Boston massacre actually were convicted, and one of them admitted to his lawyer that he was the one who shouted ""Fire"" (while discharging his weapon), and not one of the street mob. The erasure and clever distortion of those kinds of facts is exactly how a trained propagandists works, not to make big obvious lies, but to cleverly skew things in a particular direction, and also to highlight the rare event (ie, the tarring-and-feathering) to make it seem equal to common events (heavy-handed British thuggery against the population of the Americas) which are down-played, or not even mentioned!  With those kinds of factual distortions, how can any of it be trusted?  It cannot!  Oh well, that's modern film-making for you -- where directors and writers confuse their own aspirations for social change and ""influencing the masses"" with authentic telling of history.  Advice: stick to authentic documentaries, and keep fresh batteries in your BS detector."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"""Old Joy"" is a movie about a dog named Lucy. Lucy has an owner named Mark who is about to become a father. With his wife about to give birth, Mark takes off for an overnight road trip. Lucy likes this because she gets to ride along. Mark goes and gets his old friend Kurt. Kurt likes to smoke hoochie-choochie weed, but this is okay with Lucy because Kurt will pet her head enthusiastically and throw a stick for her. Lucy runs in the forest and finds a nice big stick. Kurt is taking Mark to a natural spring. Kurt gets lost. The men sit on an abandoned sofa next to a fire and play with an air gun while Lucy looks over at them. Lucy is played by Lucy the dog. She has wonderful dog expressions and a very perky tail that wags wildly with enthusiasm. Her owner Mark is played by Daniel London who was in ""Rent,"" ""The Minority Report"" & ""Patch Adams. ""  London turns in a good subtle performance as he says the right things to his friend, while constantly talking with his wife on the phone and being critical of Kurt. It's obvious that Mark has moved beyond this old buddy relationship. Kurt the buddy is played by Will Oldham who was in ""Junebug. ""  When they get to the sauna, the guys take off their clothes and Kurt tries to give Mark a massage. Mark is not comfortable with this. There are a lot of trees in the film. Kino International transferred it from 16 mm to 35 mm. It's being called artistic because it takes a long time to do very little. We get to watch sky and trees flicker by on the windshield for about four minutes. Actually, this is neither profound nor entertaining. It's a pretentious bit of cinema. That said, Lucy should have received a nomination as best animal in a movie."
Movies_and_TV_5,negative,truthful,"On the plus side, this movie serves up the most beautiful images of Italy. In fact, Italy is the star here. And I completely enjoyed all of the Italian actors who played smaller roles.  It's a pleasant, likeable, feel-good movie, and if that seems like damning with faint praise, that's because it is..  Very much a chick flick, which is not a put-down.  (And when did movies about relationships, feelings, romance come to be something to sneer at, anyway? )  There are no wizards here, no space aliens, no explosions, no threats to the future of the planet.  No violence at all.  The actors are all fine and Vanessa Redgrave is, as always, superb.  One exception is Christopher Egan, whose performance for most of the movie is over the top, which may be less inept acting than poor direction.

That being said, here's the downside:  It's going to remind you of a lightweight, made-for-tv romance of the type you can find on the Lifetime or Hallmark channel, just with a bigger budget.  The intrusive candy-pop music selections can't help but point you in that direction and make you think that perhaps it's targeted to junior high schoolers. I found myself wondering how Vanessa Redgrave had wandered into a piece of fluff like this.  The plot has more potential than substance as presented here and with each new development it's easy to predict what will happen next.  No real drama, yet no comedy either.  In fact, no tension, no suspense, no surprises, no energy or sizzle.  Which is why the best I can say about it is that it's okay.  Just okay.  But I would have been angry had I spent $10 or $12 to see it in a theater.

If you want to see a 'chick flick' that emotionally touches you, inspires you to think, has more than a passing impact, then I suggest you consider The Enchanted April or Mona Lisa Smile or the marvelous German film, Mostly Martha (the original, not the American remake)."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"Thin, cheap metal. Might be solid but it's so thin you can't tell. Only bought for the name."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"Did not stay sharp long at all. Needs replacing already. Good for a temporary use, but not long term."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,It is NOT copper - its copper color (yellowish) and its plastic but it has a nice strong light.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,Received two of the left hand.  Form doesn't allow reversing the glove to use it anyway.  Useless.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,It was my mistake I didn't think about it being a foot long which is way longer than I needed.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"Part (F) causes the regulator to be unregulated. Swopped out the new seal to the old (F), then it worked."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,These are ok - they are rather rough. Not for fine detailed work but do ok for coarse  rough removal.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,Not individually packaged with celaphane wrap like others are. The price is good and so far they seem to work well.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"Poorly made, failed first time I used it.
Can not handle any torque at all without inside cable spinning in crimp connector."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,battery  dead  in a very short time  used4 times for short time  they look nice when working
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,Water stained and hard to keep clean.  Need to wipe after each use. I would return it if I could.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,Hard to use because it will scrape the wall if you don't keep it at a perfect angle to the wall.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"For the price, it's OK. Can't complain about anything this cheap... If the price was different, wouldn't buy and wouldn't recommend."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,This product has failed after being activated to run my device twice.  The product is not a good quality product.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,You cant do 1/0 thats for sure. Very sturdy and strong. Handles are short so be ready to muscle them to crimp.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,These were priced right as an add on to another order.  Have not used them yet so do not know quality.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,why doesn't control the swing set? I bought one and my air keep cycling every minute or so....Cycling will destroy the compressor
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,The kit was missing one of the large clips and the other leads did not fit my meter properly. Very cheaply made.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,These are pretty good. The only drawback is they build up moisture internally causing some issues. Still worth the money at $16
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"is very complicated for install because my system water shower is different style , really I don't liked I hope you liked.."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,eh.  generic.. get what you pay for though.  Why in the he** do they still use flat head screws! ha

- initially operated cool but apparently started overheating and burned itself up ...
so sad."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"Nice headgear on headlamp, but it seems as though headlamp use's a lot of batteries,and for the price I expected a little better light."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"not for med size rooms maybe a room 6by6 six no larger, i wasted my time and money on this product, sorry,but, a fact!"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,I've ordered this item before and it worked but....only half the LED's would light. I sent mail to the seller but never heard back...
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,SHORT LIFE! Buy another brand. By 15 months ALL of the 8 bulbs have died. Too late to get refund. Terrible rip off product.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"Really?  The laser function is OK, but as a square, it's a joke.  I only keep it because I like the laser."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,Does not seem to hold as much tension on the blade as would be expected. It looks real good hanging on the wall though.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"I have a love hate with these, They don't last as long as they used too. But i haven't found a better replacement yet."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,Did not come with the required adhesive to attach product. Found something around the house that works but disappointed I didn't get what i purchased.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"Very cheaply made, hard to use, some of them didn't work well at all.  I guess for the price I shouldn't have expected much."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"It would be more useful if it was a bit bigger, but I would say it's a good product if you need a small safe."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"These do not stick well, and they do not hold my hand held shower head without falling off the wall. I would not buy this again."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,better be flat and level when you bring it down  or the battery could knock the door open  and it will break that latch
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,But the sticky stuff isn't quite sticky enough. Except when you want to pull off the adhesive after it falls off... then it won't come off.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,The latch broke after a few uses and I couldn't get it open. I had to destroy it to open it then I threw it out.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"These units are subpar at best, bought 9 of them, 5 of them are NOT working less than 4 months later.  Cheap quality, not durable."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,Disappointed that you can only use up to a 40 watt bulb.  Not nearly bright enough for over my island.  I've ordered something different.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"They do extend my bits out while holding them in a locked position. However, when you run the bit holder in reverse, the holder unlocks itself."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"Terrible product. Fits well, but just not enough cushion to stop noises of a chair being puled in and out of it's place at the dinner table."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"Very pretty....BUT...it's difficult to clean without streaking.  First you disinfect, then you use windex to remove streaks from cleaner.  Also....it shows every bum print!!!!!!!  :("
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,The hood is almost too tight to fit for example one of the BT color lights. My LED phone-controlled light show bulb is too large for this lamp.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,it is just a generic shower head you can buy at home depot for the same price  very noisy but has  has removable water flow protector
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,Heavier and bigger than I expected. It ended up taking too much space in my small bathroom. And the chrome paint somehow look pretty cheap. Already returned it.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"Some of them the adhesive peels off with the backing.  then they are useless. If all the adhesive stuck on it, I would give them a five."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"Doesn't look anything like this photo.  Very thin copper wire which arrives tightly wound and becomes immediately, irretrievably tangled when unwinding it.  Could be just me."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,I have used Irwin products for years and this one simply doesn't measure up --- several of the extractor bits have broken during use suggesting casting / production problems.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,Pretty much garbage. The threads only go in a couple turns and will strip out in a matter of a few light whacks. Not worth the money at all.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"Does its job but not very loud, if you are parked in your driveway there would need to be complete silence for you to hear this from your house"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"It worked great but, you would just be better off buying a new flashlight at this point.  The CREE LED flashlights cost less than $5 and work great"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"Inside the ""book"" is a metal box that locks.  The book flips open to reveal the box, which would be fine, however, the box is quite difficult to open."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,This adjustable wrench is fine for small jobs. There were some burrs on the adjustment screw and the overall finish is fairly cheap. Note that this is made in China.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"Works fine, easy to program. Very short range, though that may be a problem with my garage. I have take it off the visor and point it at the garage frequently."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"Bought two cans. Dont use on plastic. I purchased this because it was cheaper than the other product I had used before. It sucks, unless you like a crackling dripping mess."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,horrible. bought for a rental ended up not even using them. you cant screw them tight enough to stay on the handle will twist off in your hand from the outside.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,Exterior view on each handle end very poor visibly. Looks like two gears pressed together. Returning all for refund. Would work well in rental units but not for my primary residence.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,I was looking for something that could be put on a quarter round door but it has a rigid back so it won't bend...it's meant strictly for a straight door edge.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"Nothing special here.  It doesn't apply much rotational force, although it does apply plenty of downward force on the screw. If you have a driver drill, you don't need this."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"DONT BUY DONT BUY DONT BUY.......NOT DURABLE AND HANDLE BREAKS WITH LITTLE FORCE.....Cheap, does not have a feature to take off metal plate. One handle broke already. Not able to tighten handle."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"This bulb works fine, but it in no way, throws yellow colored light.  Buy the yellow ""cork screw"" type bulbs if you REALLY want to keep bugs off your front porch."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,open ended clips are bad at holding recently coiled maxline. Go get some copper 3/4 pipe clamps with 2 holes and secure your hose properly. These are too expensive and don't work.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"It's the right price when you're panicking about a draft, but haven't done any homework on weather stripping. Otherwise, I don't think it actually does much in terms of protecting against cold."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"Hopefully, this one will last. The previous First Alert Carbon Monoxide Alarm I owned was supposed to last 10 years but only lasted 4.  Same with one of their smoke detectors."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"This product title makes it sound like this is a genuine 3M part, but I see absolutely no evidence that it is. Might have paid a premium price for a generic product."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"I thought these would be easier than soldering.  I was wrong.  If you can solder, you should get a better connection and save yourself the money of buying these connectors."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,Works ok. It's a little sensitive. If you push the button sometimes it gets stuck and the bell is stuck on repeat. The same thing happens when I shut the door sometimes.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"Sturdy and well built, the jaws would meet nicely except the cutter is what stops them 1/64"" from closing. I will hone down the cutter jaws and it will work well enough."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,I use it for my small window fan. The sound is not exactly quiet and I wish there was a switch off/on. You need to pull it out from the socket to start/stop.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"I love the price, they work fine. However, there is a slight delay when turning them on. Which is strange for an LED bulb for me. The Cree bulbs do not do this."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"This Power Port is great for low powered devices like charging iPods, Phones and running LED Lighting.
However, Things that draw large current won't work. Things like air compressors, air bed pumps and the like."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,Awkward in tight locations. Poor grip on larger size lock nuts. Good quality made in USA. I have yet to find a great lock nut wrench. My GB lock nut spanner gets more use.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"The light is precious, but seems a little top heavy.  I'm afraid that it might fall out of the plug, so am having to return it.  Otherwise, beautiful design and captivating glow."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,Meh.  It came sharp.  Feels sturdy.  The blade shape makes it far wider than it needs to be and ends up being far too wide to carry everyday in my pocket.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"I don't think they seal as great as I would like, even after installing I can still feel air blowing through the outlet, but that might be from the outlet itself and not around it."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"Well this is the second one, the first was returned due to a leak. Thinking that everyone as a defect here and now, and give it another try. This one the LED does not work!!!"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"These hold downs work  o.k.  the rods are soft and bend easily, which prevents the hold down from flatly pushing on the work.  I still use them but clamping cawls are essential."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,I bought this blade for making hole cuts in ceramic tile. The blade arrived & package states it's for cutting grout. There is no mention of tile. I'm debating about retuning the item. I'm disappointed.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,Posting was misleading in that it stated it to be 8' long and didn't mention the stretchable to part. Thought I was getting a fixed length 8' but it still works OK all the same.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,Other reviews stated problems with theses bulbs. I installed two of them one lasted about 12 hours so who knows on the others. I will not buy anymore and would not suggest them to others.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"Hard to clean metal shavings out of bit. magnet is really strong but shavings prevent screws from  sitting true so you spend a lot of time cleaning the bit, pretty much after ever screw"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"The picture depicts a metal like hook, but it is all clear plastic, the hook part slips onto the support brace that is mounted to the wall, perhaps with it being plastic, it may not rust..."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"I brought 3 units in 2011.  Just put in for replacement of old timer.  3 of the 3 units I got do not work.  At the end, it just does not turn off."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"Absolutely horrible. I honestly don't think the other reviews are real. The connectors don't work. At all. I just opened the box, tried to install, and every strip has an issue.  Don't waste your money."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,piece of crap- 2nd set- this time the teeth collapsed just by hand grip pressure - no cranking down on the lock-- these vice- grips are complete trash. 1 STAR IS WAY -WAY TOO GOOD A RATING
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"Pretty good - but I had a door pinching on the cable for a bit, and it seemed to easily cut through the outer skin of the extension cord.  Nothing a little electrician's tape can't fix."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"It's ok... I didn't realize it wasn't ratcheting, if you have a 100 pound grip, you'll do fine, After my 10th cut in 3/4"" CPVC, I was done with this tool... I'll stick with the ratcheting style."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,Good product but Ive purchased over a dozen of similar led solar lights and they only seem to last approximately one year. Nice while they last but price needs to be reduced for such a short shelf life.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,i was really looking forward to using these gloves at work. They are unravelling at the base after using them less than a month.  I probably won't buy this brand for tactical/law enforcement use in the future.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"Nice product - works well BUT absolutely no instructions were included with it! The way it works is 5 stars - but I had to experiment with it for several days to figure how it worked (distances, etc)"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"Product description  incorrectly states as wireless. What they meant was one wire less. Unit did indeed need (1) traveler,  ground  and neutral wires. Itonly saves one less wire than normal. but that is not wireless...."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"Sad but true, the dimmer switch as soon as we just it it, it quits working, 1 out of 10 tries we could get the light to work.
Check all wiring , it defiantly is the poorly constructed switch."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"Works, with a little indecision on my home panel- useful there.

On my son's panel- inserting the transmitter trips the arc fault breakers (which I believe are becoming standard and required in many residential installations)! No use at all there!"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"This gel isn't really a stain, it goes on more like gloppy paint, it brushes on easily and doesn't drip or run, but it doesn't penetrate the wood like a stain does. The Honey Maple color is very orange."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"Eh, it's just okay. Sometimes it punches, and sometimes it doesn't. Very finicky. I'd recommend just using a manual center punch and a hammer until you're ready to spend money on something from Starrett or another brand like that."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,The best thing is that it's very stable and does not slip.  It has silicone grippers and good connections at bowl.  Three stars because it is not comfortable.  It has a slight ridge right where thighs rest.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"Worked well for a few months, but recently has been giving horribly inaccurate readings (half of what it should read).  If there is a way to fix it let me know, otherwise i do not recommend buying this item."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"FRAUD  - CHEAP VINYL CHINESE BOOTLEG - YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!!

These are NOT Mechanix Wear gloves. Heck, ""Mechanix"" is mispelled two different ways and IMPACT is spelled MPACT.

Horrid build. You could easily pull the fingers right off.
Returned for refund."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"THE BELT CLIP IS TOO SMALL,  LED LIGHT NOT MUCH HELP,NEED DUALS, AN INCH APART,
BIT MAGNET A BIG HELP.2 WOULD BE BETTER,1 EACH SIDE AND LONGER.
MANUALS NEED EASY SEPARABILITY BY LANGUAGE.
LETTERS ON SKETCHS USELESS. PICTURES OF TOOL SHOULD BE PHOTOS"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"I bought this nd did not use it for 6 months. I used it 5 times a a piece inside broke. Worthless, maybe I just got a lemon.  I have never had any problem with dewalts except for this one."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"I'm pretty handy, but this was impossible to use, and you'll live in mortal fear it may retract quick enough to slice open your hand. To be clear, it didn't cut me, but it retracts fast enough I believe it could."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"Not real happy with my product. It is a tiny package, much smaller than you would think. If you want 250 pieces of tiny little washers it might be what you would want. Most of this is a waste for me."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"The packaging looked interesting and we needed some extra light on our RV patio.  The lights arrived and just as I suspected.  Cheap...Cheap....Cheap.

Quickly ordered new rope lights from Camping World.  Now we are happy campers.

Pass up this one...."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"we think that even in our partially shaded yard, this light should be able to gather enough energy to light the flag the entire night. it doesn't. if you buy it, you'll have a better than average chance of being disappointed."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"These are complete crap. I had modest hopes from the beginning, but my hopes were completely dashed when the 2 blue bulbs I purchased provided poor light output and light that was more white than blue. Don't waste your money on these."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"Isn't 624ZZ supposed to be
inner dia: 4mm
outer dia: 12mm
thickness/width: 5mm

Somewhere down in the description it says 13 is outer dia.  Title does not match.  These need to be bought at precise matching in size.  Please fix the title/description appropriately."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,Not OK if you are using with a tarp zipper. The tarp is not made of blue material. It seems to be sprayed with a blue coating. The blue coating comes off on the adhesive strips. I won't buy this brand again.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"I did NOT buy my First Alert Carbon Monoxide Detector from Amazon, but it is a piece of junk. Mine only worked for less than a year and I paid enough that it should have worked a lot longer. Don't waste your money."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"Manufacturer will not honor their warranty.  My thermostat gave out in less than a month, and they won't do anything about it.  I sure wish I had bought it on Amazon instead of the HVAC thief that sold it to me."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,This didn't seem to work for what I needed it to clean. I am trying to get out set on hard water stains and yellowing from marble. This product didn't seem to help. I think I'm going to have to call a professional.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"This stuff is  the worst quality I ever had. I am a sider (construction worker), and it last about two hours , before it get holes..
 Similar gloves I get from Chinese store (for half price) last for 1 day.
Don't waste your money!!!!"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"I installed four of these bulbs in kitchen recess fixtures less than a year ago, and three of them have already gone dark.  These lights probably burned 5 hours a day on average.  Do the math, and do not buy these bulbs."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,Only 3 out of 4 bulbs worked. I have been using them for 3 weeks now and they are all turning black. They look terrible if they are off. My first impression was good deal but not at all after 2 weeks it went downhill.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"this does not fit on the Jet saw, we had to rig it up with dryer hose to be able to hook it up to the dry vac :((  it's not 4"" it's 3 3/4"" which doesn't fit over the piece on the saw"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"Light always stays on, wired it every which way possible.  Not sure if its supposed to, but I needed a 240volt switch to control a compressor located in a back room and wanted the light to only be on when the switch is on."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"Spray tube was missing from the can so I have to go to a bricks & mortar store now just to get it.

The cap on the can is notched to store the spray tube so someone screwed up and didn't include it in my shipment.

Ugh..."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,Be careful and take it easy with this thing. I did three sinks and got all kinds of nasty stuff out. But on the fourth sink it got completely stuck and I had to take the drain apart to get it out. They ARE REUSABLE also.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"not such a strong light, I have purchased a type like this before and the other light was bigger and brighter and has been outside in use for more than 7 months.
this light is small, cheap to the touch , lets see how long it last?"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"2 of these bulbs died within a few weeks in this 8pack so it pretty much was a waste of a deal for me. Also, these bulbs were a little too 'white' in terms of their brightness. I think I'll pass on these things next time."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"1 of the 3 lights motion detectors only works when you are a few inches away from it.  And one of them is only as bright as a nightlight with new batteries installed.  So 2 of the 3 are defective, that's 2/3 of them."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"These are cheap. I'm not talking price wise, I mean cheaply made. The silver has started to flake off and I've bent one of the brass punches already. I'm not happy with them. At least they were Price cheap too. You get what you pay for."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,1 1/2 years equals one star. I'm starting to wonder if anything is built to last anymore. Another cracked seat as others have posted. I suppose left handed folks will have their crack on the opposite side. The bold look of Kohler. Are you listening yet Kohler!
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,I bought these with the intention of using them in my Dremel tool (not actually a Dremel but a craftsman type Dremel). But they won't work in it because the shaft is too small and the collet won't tighten up enough to secure the shaft to it.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"Waste of money.  The batteries only last for max 20 hours (if at all).  What is the point?  Batteries are almost more expensive than the string lights.  I have never ever given a 1-star rating, there is always a first... and appropriately so."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"This cartridge is a piece of junk. The plastic stop on the stem keeps breaking. Other people have the same problem. (eg read the reviews on the Home Depot webpage.)  You can't even get the plastic stop itself, you have to buy the whole cartridge. Ridiculous."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,Sometimes a little difficult to get the right bite.  A little uncomfortable after a couple uses.  But you rarely have to use one of these.  And a lot of fittings come with this already.  So now I have a small jar full of them.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,Color rendering of this lamp is sub par. The color temperature seems cooler than the indicated 3000K as well. Overall a harsh light that does not work well in a residential setting. Consider it for a utility space perhaps? Quickly returned and replaced by a superior Philips lamp.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"I was very satisfied with these lights having instant brightness when they came on, but then without any warning they just went out and would not come back on. They were only on my garage for 1 year. I will not take another chance buying this brand again."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"I do like that you can point the draft in all directions. however, it's insanely flimsy. also the frame is smaller than the register I had there before. there is a small gap that is not being covered at the edge. my old register covered the gaps just fine."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"Smart design. Like the fact that the keyring is integral to tool. Issue I normally have with key chain tools is separating the tool from the key, a problem than this tool solves rather well. That said, I have barely used it, and much prefer  the leather-man squirt."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"Worked great for about 2 days, and now it won't keep the signal. It stays on maybe 10 minutes a day, and has been the biggest waste of money I've had in a long time.

The notifications stopped working completely, and so did the motion alerts. Don't waste your money."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"This is an ok tool to have. When I first received it the safety pin on the handle spinner came off and got lost in the mail, I replaced the pin with a new one and made some adjustments to spinner to keep it in place, now it work ok."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,It is a good option for a beginner who does not mind spending the extra money.  It is over priced for the purpose it serves if you have good wood working skills.  It is a well made product 4 for quality but a 2.5 star for the price
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"Disappointed.  It would not split some logs I could split with a maul.  The motor takes a couple seconds to spool up for each stroke, which is annoying.  The design requiring both hands to engage probably keeps some lawyer happy somewhere but is very clumsy to operate."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,We went with a different set up but we are keeping these as we could use this in our kids play house. It's longer then we hoped for and a difficult application but if you need a universal bracket for the ceiling or end of window mounting this will work.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"Warm white does not mean clear. I was hoping this string would match the clear LED lights on the rest of my house, but while they are not as ""blueish"" as the soft white LED's they still have a tiny blue hue to them. Aside from that they were fine."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"Wasn't too impressed with this, it was broken and I needed to return it. I did not reorder because o just wasn't impressed with the material or it. I figured if it was broken so easily when it supposed to be sturdy and strong there was no sense and re-ordering it."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"I gave this product 3 stars only because I feel that it is very well made however, for me it was not a good choice because it is just too bulky to carry around. It will protect the flashlight and if you don't mind the size, it is worth the money."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"I bought two, one malfunctioned within a week. The alarm goes off several times a day. I placed two in the same room, this one goes off, the other other doesn't. Placed both next to an opened window, same thing: this one goes off for no reason and claims there is fire."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"PROs
 Small flashlight that fits in your pocket

CONs
 Wrist strap is too small to fit on a human wrist.
 Keychain hole is too small for it to fit on even a small keychain ring.
 Product was defective and focus could not be adjusted
 Maglite company did not respond to query about defective product"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,There is a reason it is so inexpensive. It emits a loud buzz when a USB device is plugged into it. And it is so wide that it would be dangerous to install in a metal box or in any box with another device. Spend a few more bucks on a better product.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"Made like garbage. These Cree bulbs are made of glass covered with a thin layer of soft plastic. While bright enough, they will break - shattering the inner glass - at the slightest provocation. I ordered several of these bulbs and half arrived broken or with defects in the plastic layer covering the glass."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,Beautiful quality product. I gave a 3-star rating only because these lights have to be wired into power source and can NOT be used with a cord and adapter as the description says. Even the instructions in the box say can't be used with cord. Buy it only if you can hard wire it in.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"Whoever created it did it backwards so that the sticky side of the letters was facing the sticker side of the paper and therefore required me to remove each letter one by one to apply to the wall. I have gotten a lot of these types of decals for my home, this was made wrong."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"These were MUCH too small for most projects. Short of sealing a bag or sausages, I'm not sure what you would use these for. I purchased them to build cages, and they just wouldn't work.

On the plus side, they are comfortable and easy to use. I like the idea of the auto feed, much more convenient."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"This keeps the garage tidy by keeping the bikes upright. But it doesn't fit bikes with disc brakes very well. Just a little more room, a dip in the bar, whatever, would have made these much better to not mess up my discs. Aside from that, assembly was easy, and it seems very sturdy and durable."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"Loses connection and goes red after a couple days. Reconnected this thing 5 times and every time it works for a few days then loses connection and have to set it up on wireless again. Other wireless devices in the home work fine (hue hub, skybell, homeboy, nest, etc.). Whenever I really need it working it's not."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,I thought my metal table top was ready to use after one day of drying.  Wrong!  Cure time is 7 days!  I have use this product on other outdoor metal furniture.  It does OK stopping rust.  I have also used the spay-on black Hammerite which seems to be better at stopping rust.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"Greatly diappointed. Post was cracked, no attachment provided for the upper mast, and the method for the ""no digging"" installation was beyond pathetic. After putting it all together and installing it, I could push it over easily. The area around the stake was solid and firm, but there was just no stability what so ever in this design."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,They flicker and do not dim fully. These are cool white-nowhere near warm white. As expected the cool white stayed the same color when dimmed. The whole reason for dimmable lights is to create a more romantic atmosphere. Think candle light. The light must become redder than warm white. So we replaced the bulb with a tungsten bulb.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"Installed by a insured and bonded plumber with 30 years on the job. Brand new arm, brand new plumbing, professionally assembled. It leaked even with Teflon tape. Fitting are plastic to metal and after the first installation the plastic threading is destroyed ruining the seal. Not a single connection was water tight. This is an expensive plastic junk."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"Update!!! See photos for my issue.
Its the wrong hinge for my door. Pay attention the overlay door sizes.  Hoping seller will exchange still for the ones I need.

Be sure to install before the 30 day return window closes.  They don't adjust well at all.  They do fit exact in the existing hinges space but adjustments are poor."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"Went on great.  Tried to limit the amount so that we did not get the cloud effect that we read in the instructions.  However, after a few rain showers we had to scrub the tiles as they had a white film all over.  Could be user error but I doubt it as we followed directions very closely."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"Well ok, I got it quickly and it looks nice, but I bought it without really thinking. This requires a 3 hole sink which isn't what I bought and by the time I'd gotten around to putting everything together it was too late o send this back. Lesson learned, but like I said it looks nice. Im sure it works..lol.."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"It seemed like a cool idea not to have to use threaded pipe for bar clamps and they have been working fine more or less, but I don't like the way the clamp head flops around while you're trying to line things up. Maybe I'm just used to the way the threaded type heads stay put while you're cranking on them."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"For a very cheap knife that comes with a fire starter, this is a good one. It is made in china though.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"Not comfortable, they push on my head behind my ears with a lot of force. I have this problem with a lot of safety glasses. Not trying to advertise another product over this one, but the 3M Tek are the only safety glasses I've found that I don't have this issue with. If you don't have this problem, they should work for you."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"Not as good as other Mr Beams products, firstly the Locked and Unlocked direction are wrong, (who signed off on mass production for that? someones head should roll for that) so I nearly broke it trying to ""unlock"" it which was actually ""locking"" it  Now the back cover plate is very loose and doesnt stay on.  Besides that very bright light"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"Not a security light.  It does not produce enough light.  My iPhone makes more light on flashlight mode.  I hung it center above my two car garage.  It looks tiny and a little ridiculous.  The guy that bought 10 of them to line his fence looks cute though, but I am not interested in spending $50 for these."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"Had issues with being outdoors and the unit not turning on.  Appears to have an issues with the battery compartment keeping water out when it rains.  I allowed the unit to dry out and it never came back on, even after several days of sunshine in an effort to see if it would charge.  Worked great up until the rain."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,The wire is very flexible and should work fine.  I marked it down because the red and black wires are completely separate from each other and this was not made clear in the description.  I was expecting a single two conductor wire not two one conductor wires.  The title and description are worded so that it could be taken either way.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"Give a nice dull light on top of the pillar.  More light would be nice, but for the price it is what I expected.  By no means is this light to assist in vision, just to create a barrier.
Edit: purchased 4. Lights quit recharging within 6 months. Do not have access to batteries. Very cheap and poorly made. I would not buy again."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"The right-angled claw side does not dig out the heads of framing nails as well as my old [lost] one. Too much of the wood has to be dug out to grab the nail. Further, the tool is a bit too long in hanging from one's tool belt...constantly clanging against things as you move around the job site. I wouldn't recommend it to another carpenter."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"All I wanted was something to tell me how many watts my appliances are consuming.
I can figure out the cost myself.  But it won't tell me what the wattage consumption is.  Need to plug it in for a kilowatt hour or so.  And how do I translate that back to wattage?
Way too complicated, and misses what I had hoped was its basic purpose.
Sending it back."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"Sockets are well made, well plated and fit well. The problem is that the square drive end doesn't have the required divots in it so that the sockets can attach to the ball retainers of extensions or ratchets. They are only held on the attachment by friction which isn't much. I find this a fatal flaw. Other than this they aren't bad but that's a deal breaker for me."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"Xmas Gift. Had to replace tube and starter on day one. Blinked constantly. Finally Quit altogether after using three times. As an artist, I require dependable light over my board. Also had problems with swing arm and light
placement. I was just trying to reposition light tubes when the product
JUST FAILED. What a waste of $$$!  Will now have to find a more dependable
alternative."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"These function well however they aren't ideal for fixtures where the bulb is visible. The light from these bulbs is concentrated from a small spot in the bulb and as such has an intense, bright light if it isn't covered with a shade or diffuser. Also, the bottom half of the bulb is white plastic. If it's something that bothers you, they don't look great when the bulbs aren't actually on."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"Easy to use, instructions were clear. Now, how sensitive it is cannot be determined with my single use. The smell of gas was so slight and outdoors I'm not sure it is able to detect it as it registered no presence. Naturally it cannot compete with detectors costing many hundreds of dollars, however, at the price and as a supplement to your own nose,  I would have it on hand."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,It did not work for me as hoped. I had some wiggly seats that I thought this would help. The washers were too big to secure the bolt as they did not fit as described in the instructions. The wrench also did not work as it was unable to grab the plastic nuts. I ended up getting some Mayfair seats with metal bolts and 1/2 nuts that tighten perfectly in the holes.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"DOA. Transmitter light would light up with finger activation but reciever light would not....and it did not switch power on or off with a lamp plugged into device. Went to manufacturer's website...only support option was email but there was a main number listed for company. Called the number and got transferred after a few rings to a fax tone.

More Chinese junk and lousy support of it. Returned item same day I received it."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"While this tool has a place (mostly for measuring around curved surfaces) it is difficult to be very accurate because the lines marking the distances don't extend all the way to the edge of the tape so you have to guess a bit.  It would be more useful, I think, if the story pole feature was only on one edge of the tape so the lines could extend to the other edge."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"I haven't used this yet but with only a 1/4"" hex shank, I don't expect this to last long before snapping. After I ordered this, I found the Stanley Proto with 7/16"" hex shank. What a difference. I doubt the shank will ever snap so I recommend buying the Stanley Proto for the extra money. I'm stuck with the Dewalt model as a backup because I would lose money if I returned it."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"Two issues. It's called a 'cliplight' but there's no 'clip' anywhere on the thing! i was thinking i would be able to clip it to a shirt. Second, the switch is on the same side as the light. For it's position, it's natural to turn it on with your thumb, thereby blinding yourself when it first turns on.

Good things: the magnets are in good positions and are really strong, the LEDs are super bright!"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"I never got this product from this vender.  CT Power Tools informed me within a day or two that the product was out of stock and they were uncertain how soon they might have it, that it was probably going to be a month or two. I canceled the order and resourced it.
I would and probably will do business with this vender again as I very much appreciate their timely responses and honesty."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"The product looked great, however I ordered a 1 inch pressure vacuum breaker and I got a 3/4 instead.  I had to get my sprinkler fixed so I ended up having to buy one locally for $111.00 and then I also had to take and drop the incorrect one off at the UPS store.  Aside from the item being wrong, it looked like the $111.00 part I bought, just the wrong size."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"I finally replaced my old brass doorknobs with these on my coat closet in the living room and I'm not thrilled with them. They fit and work perfectly but the finish is so dull. I thought that was just a bad photo, but that's actually exactly what they look like... lifeless, colorless and dull.  Then again, they were only $4 each...lol.  I'll have to get better ones because I can't stand looking at them."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"The light functions are great. However when I set the time, date and temperature and moved the top section to another position, the settings all changed. Happened many times after I reset. The alarm is just to soft to be useful. This is a very sleek modern light and I loved the blue light backing on the functions. Unfortunately, it just would not work properly. Possibly a shorted wire inside."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,Don't really hate it. Would give it 3 stars I just read the worst reviews first because of the flaws. If I had longer wrenches this would be ideal. 14 pockets but the wrenches sink in the pockets. Material seems very sturdy to give it a long lasting feeling. Corner edge is to long for regular 17 inch deep tool box but the extra space just folds up. The 5782 was a way better fit for everything.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"In Sink Erator is quieter, less rumbly, and better in every way.  This is in every way inferior.

The InSinkErator has a downward draft that drew refuse downward.  This does not.  The bad engineering of the muffler/entrance with sharp points impales food (particularly noodles etc) and that does not go down to the disposer.  If you push, the entire plastic entrance device comes out.  You need to keep reinserting this.

This is dreadful engineering."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"I placed 2 orders for these LED bulbs, as I decided to replace all bulbs with LED bulbs.  One bulb burned out within 2 months.  Today the second bulb burned out...6 months after I bought them.  Amazon did issue me a credit for the bulbs.  The price is right, the bulbs are bright, and our electric bill went down about $15 a month......but I'm a little concerned about the life expentency of the bulbs."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,This faucet is a piece of junk. It worked fine for the first six weeks that we had it. And then it started leaking in multiple places - after the ability to return it to Amazon for a refund expired. All Pfister will do is send us a replacement part. The item is clearly not well made if it doesn't even last past six week. Buy something else! We like the look of it - but it's junk.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,I bought this as a Christmas gift for my husband. Unfortunately he already have one of the same model - which he did not like much. He said the battery doesn't really hold as it should. My biggest complaint about this purchase is that I was charge restocking fee upon return and $16 dolars return shipping. So if you buy this only do it if you are certain that is what you want.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"I'm still puzzled by this light...

It does the job (although tonight it's completely off... not sure why), but (to my understanding), there is only ONE type of use:
IF there is light on the solar panel, it charges and the light is off,
otherwise:
if there is movement, the light shines bright (which is what you want)
if there is no movement, the light shines dimly but noticeably. I don't think there's a way to turn it off, but I wish there was."

These bulbs had claimed all that I was looking for. Color, dimmable, and lumens. But, in reality, they are: GU10 LED bulb replacements, are dimmable, are the right color, but are most definitely not anywhere near the lumen output that is claimed. Actual measurement was 210 lumen each.
Just keep waiting folks. The tech will eventually get it right."

I used professional mold remover and a mold shield ( Zep Brand ) and treated it heavy for 2 days to make sure whatever it was is gone, and won't come back.

All made in China, probably by the same factory."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"First, I really like these levels. The design and build quality are great ... EXCEPT, the middle size level was OUT OF LEVEL. Basically, you set the level on any surface close to level, then make a mark on the surface at the end of the level and take a reading. Next rotate the level and place the other end of the level at the mark and take another reading. You should get the same reading both ways. I had to return."

However, after buying these, I may switch brands. I've only used 3 of the bulbs and already I've had 1 die off within 2 months of usage in my bedroom light. A standard light bulb would've lasted longer and wouldn't have cost anywhere near what I paid for these. I'm very disappointed and will consider other brands in the future."

No hose (which costs about $22 at local store) and nothing for it to hang from or connect it to the shower pipe (which costs about $11 at store).  What?!  So, this no frills shower head ends up costing over $60 (nearly $70) when all is said and done.  No thanks...sending it back.  I'll  go get an all in one Delta or whatever."

I kept the bag empty and the pads changed, yet it still fried itself and shot craps.  I would only recommend this is you were doing very small projects spaced out in time.

LADIES:  You will find this sander to be uncomfortable to use as the palm grip is HUGE.  Defiantly designed for and by a man."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"I got it because it has a magnetic end. Which is strong and holds on to the piece of metal that you want to hang on the wall. Well built and withstands drops from a couple of feet.

Edit: middle bubble it doesn't really give an accurate reading. Half of the liquid is gone :/ kinda worthless just to use the level vertically only."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"Purchased these as a bundle with a black light flashlight.  They work well thou they don't fit over my fat head very well.  Have put these over the lenses of the black light when on a florescent stain and they do block enough that you cant see the stain any longer.  Have also discovered that having these on stops my Transitions lenses from darkening when outside.  Not blown away since they don't fit over my head well, but they do exactly what is advertised."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"It seems reasonably well made, but they didn't mention that it takes a T6 bulb in the description. The body is too thin to accept anything else, e.g. a candelabra base flame bulb.

Also, the switch is next to the plug which means that to turn it off, you have to get down to the outlet where it's plugged in! Not very convenient.

It's also not really very well made. When you put a bulb in it, the socket sags so one end of the bulb is visible. Overall it's a bit flimsy."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"Price to performance, this tool is pretty great. Performs extremely well with very light use. But as soon as you start to torque with this, forget it, you're better off using your bare hands.
The handles of the pliers, after about 3 weeks of light use, began to flop around which made this tool useless. The joints where the pliers and the handles join is crucial to the performance of this tool. There is no way to take this tool apart and repair those joints. So if it fails, the tool is garbage."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,It worked great until about month and a half the light would stay on.  It would then go through all 3  light modes.  Couldn't turn it off.  Had to remove battery to shut it off.  It was very bright and nice when it worked.  I have always through streamlight was a good product but now don't know.  I am frustrated now paying that much money for a light that only lasted month and a half that now I have to send back to streamlight and wait.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"I know about flashlights.  Nothing in this review will be an exaggeration, honestly.  This light is not usable in any sense.  The output can only be described as dim.  Thats not a comparative statement.  The ""beam"" is orange and barely visible.  If you're looking at something small within 2ft of your face,  you can see it if you strain your eyes.  Negotiating the dark is impossible.  Ive honestly never seen a dimmer light in any size, and this one is alot larger
than most keychain lights."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"I realy liked the gun, nice and smooth work but it just broke. Description says it will not brake within a year and it did not but it broke one year and two months later after purchase. The worst part of it, is that I can NOT get parts for this gun anywhere. The ""driver"" which broke is easy to replace if you can get it, but you can not, so gun goes to the garbage and I will come back to the Hitachi which parts you can get easly and repair by yourself."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"The first pair I received had a missing battery cover; I called the customer service # in the box and the service was outstanding. I received the replacement within 2 days.  I was impressed by the service. However, the lanterns themselves are a bit fragile, quality not so hot, one of them doesn't stay lit all night, even though I charged them both fully and equally.  I like that they clip onto the umbrella, and I like the glow out on the deck that they they create alongside my rope lighting along the deck."

It feels flimsy but works well. I can now get into my teeny tiny indoor attic opening. Dropped one star because it feels flimsy, although I've had no problems with it holding my weight. Dropped another star because of the danger factor. Be very careful when lowering this ladder. Keep your hands under the switches or a trip to the hospital for a smashed finger/hand may be in order."

I have several locations and have never had an issue, to date. I hear the Ecobee works better too, but these Nests are a joke. The Radio Thermostat does not have the ""sensing away"" capability, but that is one of many things that will not work well on the Nest you paid $250 for."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,I was happy when I order the product and looking forward to using my lamp post.  The quality to use them as a lamp post was not the best.  So I thought no big deal I will use them on my deck.  Only 2 of the lights work.  I have changed the batteries in all of them. In the inside something will not make contact with the light.  I contacted the seller and there was no restitution to the problem.  So I use the casing and I put tea lights in them.

The first time i only got the handle. Second time i only got the bender. both times the same sticker with the model number was on both. They needed to have Part 1 of 2 and part 2 of 2 on the stickers.  If you order this you may only get a handle, or you may only get a bender.  You should be getting both parts for this price."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"Okay, initially sent in a five-star rating, but this is why I hate to commit to a review early on; I've had this light installed for just a few months and it has failed.  Constant on/off of the light once is gets to dusk; had to shut it off altogether.  I wish I had looked at the negative reviews first because I wouldn't have bought this.  I'm not planning on getting any satisfaction from the company because apparently, they don't honor warranties, but I will try.  It's too bad; it seemed to be just what I wanted."

There is no way I would trust it to be accurate and use it in any situation. It is a dangerous device in my opinion and will frequently give ""False negative"" readings - indicating there is no power running through a wire when there actually is.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"Nice little tool and am convinced some of the features can actually be used successfully in a survival situation if practiced and done with care.  For example, the compass has to be completely level to work.  If not it will jam and give wrong direction.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"So contrary to what Bosch has said, the intermittent unresponsive trigger issue has not been resolved. It was only occasional at first but grew worse over time. Depending on how fine your work is, it can either be at the least a nuisance or at worst cause damage to your work. I also want to add that the plastic membrane covering the battery indicator started peeling off both on the battery I used and the brand new one that I kept in the box after initial charging. I returned the drill and bought another brand. Do not buy this drill until V2 comes out!"

It was to short and did not make contact in order to turn the light bulb on- I tried modifying both to make them work- no luck, so needing to buy the same adapter from a different maker at this point.  I ruined the ones I got but I suppose that's okay- they are cheap.  Just wish I had read the other 1 star reviews then I would have known this adapter wouldn't work for me either."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"I think I bought 6 of these for a new house. We live in a rural area where the electrical service provided by the co-op is pretty shakey. So we have a lot of power outages. Whole lotta fun being waken up at 3 or so in the morning when a power outage causes one of these alarms to trigger. It took a while to figure out the problem and isolate the one bad one. Looking at the warranty instructions, I would have to pay shipping both ways and most probably they would say there is nothing wrong with it. Nope, not gonna play that game."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,F***** makita is dissapointing me. I want one of these so badly but i cannot get one that works as it should. I bought one through home depot and had to return it because it was burning my plywood edges nasty and struggling to cut. Also the track was warped. Then i bought one through amazon and it never arrived. Got my money back and purchased it again. But again the track is not straight and now this saw makes a very weird sound as soon as u turn it on. Returned it and waiting for a replacement. Hopefully third  time is a charm with amazon.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,I decided to tile my house and used a tile saw that has seen a fair amount of usage and it was time for a new blade as the old one was chipping the glazed porcelain tile really bad. I noticed this blade was much larger than the old one but I can only assume that is due to the amount of wear on the old one. This worked well for about 40 cuts then started chipping the tiles also. I ended out buying a much better blade and it hasn't chipped a single one yet. I guess I should know you get what you pay for.

I use a coping saw to rough cut my molding, and use this to get shave things down to a 1/32 of a inch.  It's too thick to hold like a pen, so I hold it like a paring knife.  The LEDs shine in my eyes so I had to block them with masking tape (there's no on/off).  The locking button (for changing bits) sometimes gets pushed when I'm holding it, and it's inconvenient to increase the speed while I'm using it since the speed buttons are on the other end.

This is our second set of these, and the first set performed the same. Along with the B.S. claim of how long they stay lit, two of them quit working completely-no light whatsoever. They look nice on, and off, but are definitely not worth the premium price we paid for them. We were hoping the second set would work out, but no such luck. Trying different batteries didn't change the lighting problem."

Batteries last only a few months and then show to be defective.  I expected more from Ridgid.  I finally chunked the two drills and  changed to a Dewalt 18V.  Single unit with 2 batteries.  A bit larger but so much more power and after 6 months the Dewalt Batteries still going good.

However, after we took it outside to use it on a tire....it didn't work. It couldn't pump it up. It says not to let it run more than 10 minutes.

I finally removed the thing, got one of those magnetic base work lights with a stiffer goose neck, stuck it to the DeWalt metal stand, problem solved for now.

The lock is a total failure. The iPhone has to have the app open or it doesn't work, the lock locks arbitrarily, often after I use the key to get in and it locks as I'm closing it (sending the bolt into the doorframe)
When it does work the mechanism is so slow that I would never want to be trying to get into the house in a panic situation.
I have calibrated and re-calibrated,  all to no avail.

I got the remote/dimmer, which works as expected. I used almost a whole roll in an area about 1 x 2 feet, and the brightness is not excessive. This was tough, since I needed to make a lot of connections to remain in a tight area.  The HitLights connectors are a royal pain, and you will have an unreliable flickering mess if you need to use more than a couple of them. I recommend you plan to solder your connections.

You would be happier to spend a few extra dollars and get a american made knife that has some quality. It did not come with that hair popping blade that i was hoping for, it could barely pass the paper cutting test and that finish that Gerber puts on their blades, whats that all about?

These have been failing often for me when the rod fails to break at the rivet start... which has caused me much despair b/c I end up having to try and get the rivet to release w/out messing up my work.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"This lamp is very basic. The warning label was designed for the older style incandescent light bulbs. That is out of date. The shade is too short to accommodate the longer twist fluorescent bulbs. The twist bulbs produce less heat than the older style incandescent light bulbs. A 60 watt maximum for incandescent light bulbs, which produced a dim yellow light and lots of heat, is too limited. The electric cord had a long ""flag"" label wrapped around it, with an admonition to not remove it. Ha! Right! I'm going to leave the stupid label to interfere with my using the electric cord, safely! Time to design a lamp for the modern bulb, fluorescent or LED.

It IS absolutely positively beautiful. Looks to be well made. But has been problematic from the get go. My first one came defective (leaked internally). Getting a replacement was easy through Amazon. But, I still had to pay the plumber twice.

Worked great for about 6 months, then the sprayer started leaking. My bad for not contacting the company. It continues to leak, particularly if water is on high. In addition, it doesn't like to stay seated in the holder. Very disappointing. I love the faucet. Wish it worked better. Needs a bit of a design redo in my opinion."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"Another reviewer wrote about this and I missed it, so here it is again:  If the power is turned off to this unit, it trips.  The other reviewer points out the best or worst case example:  If you plug aquarium equipment into this, and the power goes out, even for a blink, you must press the reset button to restore power to the equipment.  A lamp would be another bad thing to plug into this, since you would have to find and press the reset button to turn the lamp back on.  An alarm clock would be a bad idea for obvious reasons.

If you can live with this constraint (I could), then the good news is that it seems to work in all other respects."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"Markings are clear, tape can extend to approximately 8 feet without flexing. I liked the concept of the self locking bit, seemed very handy.  First project I needed it for I had to measure from the wall to a spot on the ceiling.  After at least a dozen tries I could not keep the extended tape steady.  I tried different angles, pointing it up, sideways and backwards.  No go; it kept flexing.  Worst of all, the tape did not lock as advertised.  I could not get an accurate measurement, even on the floor.  If I extended the tape past 6 feet, it slowly retracted on its own approx. 1/8 inch.  That happening once I could live with.  Repeatedly?  No thanks.  Returned it."

1. This allows you to get ""flatter"" against your work, so it's critical for certain tasks.
CONS:
1. Very cheaply constructed, and doesn't last long.  You'll need to replace these regularly.
2. Runs very hot and noisy.
3. Very difficult to install and remove from the main unit.  Not something you can just swap on and off easily.
TIPS:
1. Don't run it too fast, or for too long.  Let it cool off from time to time.
2. When installing and removing shafts (the rod with the disc at the end), insert a spare shaft through the hole near the tip of the angle attachment, to prevent the main shaft from turning while you tighten or loosen it.  If you use the button that's built-in to the main tool, you'll strip the gears in the right-angle attachment."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"Nice quality light... everything looks great and is well made. A few complaints though...

First complaint was there were no installation instructions included. Even the website didn't offer any help, offering just an email to contact.

Second, this was apparently designed to be attached directly to the ceiling and not to a ceiling electrical box as it did not come with the right parts. The cover for the ceiling was also barely big enough to cover the standard-size box I had. After messing around with extra screws and brackets, I did manage to get it installed quite nicely, no thanks to the included accessories.

Third, the set screw that you tighten down to hold the cord in the lamb base is nylon and stripped out with almost no pressure.

Overall, it looks fantastic, but the installation procedure was ridiculous."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"Buyer beware - the MOST COMMONLY USED #2 Phillips driver DOES NOT FIT - it's more like a #1.5 Phillips - making this driver prone to stripping out screws, and having an extremely poor hold / bite on the fastener itself.  Way to ruin a nice set of tools, Wiha.  I'm returning this set, and looking for another manufacturer.  I had high hopes, though I saw another comment from 2014 stating this same problem, I figured Wiha would have gotten around to addressing this problem in the 2 years since.  Boy was I wrong.  The #2 Stubby Phillips fits perfect, for what that's worth.

Why keep a set, when the driver I use the absolute most, does not properly fit - and they have made no effort to rectify this in the years since?"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"I bought this item in January last year and was quite pleased with the initial operation.  After 6 months or so, the motion detector sometimes did not turn on the lights and I had to walk through the dark kitchen to tap on the sensor to make it work.  Now the sensor never works and this is simply a manual switch.

I emailed Enerlite and their customer service rep said ""We don't usually get involved with our retailer's customers"", and told me to seek help from Amazon.  But of course it's been a year, so I guess that's all the help I am going to get.  The price is low, but not low enough to warrant buying another one year light switch, so goodbye Enerlite.  It's a shame because I really loved this switch in the beginning."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"Like most folks, I'd like to spend as little money as possible to complete my projects. Skimping here was not a great idea, however. If you're not aware of what a proper connector should look like, or if durability is not a concern, then this certainly looks like a great deal. It's half the price of a quality part. And I've returned mine, because I'm not willing to save money at the expense of significant quality reduction. Yes these look like the connector you want. But don't be fooled. They're the Playskool version of the real thing. Great for display or demonstrations, but I won't use them to pass 30A of 230V.

I never thought I'd become a ""connector snob"" but here I am. The high quality Leviton units are well worth the extra money, because their quality IS that much better."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"Very disappointed for three reasons. 1) A small atomic weapon is required to open the packaging.  2) The hose is very stiff.  That makes the hand-held part difficult to maneuver and also transmits motion to the  head bracket.  And 3) the hose connectors are absolutely smooth and thus impossible to tighten by hand.  And the use of any tool will mar the finish.  At least one other model apparently has ""ridged connectors"" because the directions which came with mine refers to them.

I wonder if it was not Water Pik's intention to punish me for buying an inexpensive model?

From what I saw in the store (mine was not purchased from Amazon) the packaging is such that you cannot see the hose and connector type until you have purchased the thing and somehow have managed to open it."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"The bar does not fit into the two ends snuggly.  This is I can live with since this is the only bar whose depth fits into the space I have available in my bathroom for a towel bar.  However, what I find rather inexcusable is that the towel bar does not come with wall anchors for the screws.  Given how little wall anchors cost, there was no reason to not include some with the packaging.  The screws were loose and the bar was in constant danger of falling down (and in fact did fall down a few times) until I went down to the local store and got some wall anchors for #8 screws for less that $1.50 for 4 anchors.  With the drywall anchors that I bought separately, the towel bar is a lot more secure now."

This heater stays cool to the touch and the coils don't get very hot seemingly but it has some pretty good output. It takes a while to bring a room up to temperature but once it's there it really holds it there. It is 25 degrees outside and the heater is keeping my living room at an even 65 all by itself.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"The seat is easy to install and aesthetically pleasing. Toddler seat is stable. The reason why I gave it 3 stars is because the seat is very flat. There is no rise or ""horn"" in the front. When you have a newly potty trained toddler, they don't always understand leaning forward or making sure their privates are right over the hole, especially when they are trying to balance on top of a tall toilet. This problem applies to both a boy (especially) and a girl. If you have a squirmy toddler, the chances of peeing onto the top of the toilet seat is pretty high. My recommendation to the company is to add a contoured toddler seat. This seat is probably best used with an older toddler who understands the concept of being over the hole with no guidance from a contoured seat. We're returning ours."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"Good value - but all of the locks are opposite.  So when they are in the ""unlocked"" position, they are vertical.

The door jam plates didn't line/up or work on 1/2 of our order of 10, so we just used the old ones for now.  One set that we used ended up failing after a month (locking mechanism didn't open/shut all the way and it became a nuisance - had to just uninstall it and now have to be replaced.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"DO NOT buy a Streamlight because you think there's a lifetime warranty, there really isn't. You have to read the fine print.

I bought and received a genuine Streamlight Microstream (NOT an imported knock-off), and have loved it while it worked. The problem I have with the company is their misleading use of the term ""LIMITED lifetime warranty"". Let me explain. Streamlight's ""LIMITED lifetime warranty"" doesn't apply to electronics, bulbs, batteries, or switches, just to what they deem as manufacturer's defects. So, basically, their so-called warranty applies only to manufacturing defects in the aluminum body-tube of the light. NOT COOL, Streamlight... you want us to ""Buy American"", but you have a crappily designed switch that wreaks of designed obsolescence.

Cost of a replacement tail cap/switch is $12 ($4 + $8 shipping), which is hardly worth it, especially considering that the LED emitter has been upgraded from 35 to 45 lumens."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"Bought this to remove one coat of floor paint.  Soygel after 6 hours removed 40% of the paint perfectly and the other paint not at all, but what it left me is a softened paint that will not come up and has left a coating on my floor like sticky gum.  In short this proruct ruined my floor and I have been forced to buy a concrete grinder.

The product was down for 7 hours.  I then tried another test of 24 hours with the same result on one of the sections that was untouched.

Also there is a strong smell from this product, not too noxious but there is absolutely an odor.

I think if I just used this on latex it would work but for me to prepare for tile this product has been nothing short of a disaster.  I really wanted this to work."

I made sure the spray tip was clean and unclogged, but the spray came out all spattery and uneven (I have a very good finesse for spraying paint from a rattle can, and this can just sprayed really badly). Now that it is set up, with a full two coats and two days of dry time at optimal temperature, the paint still scuffs with the slightest provocation. Even a soft paper towel scuffed the paint. This is a primer/paint combo, but I still prepped my surface with a good sanding and cleaning. This paint just doesn't have the quality I have come to expect from Krylon."

I am currently trying to contact the Sporting Goods place that sells these through Amazon to try to resolve. Turns out I got them here on Amazon, and the ones I got are very cheaply made, very poor manufacturing and you can't reach the company that makes them, so I would not recommend.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"Worked great but failed to heat after a year. Visually identical to one I bought at a ""big box"" store.  One of many cheaply made brands, usually constructed in foreign nations and imported.  This particular one failed like two others we bought because they use a mechanical thermostat that uses inferior materials for the electrical contacts.  After a year or so of constant use, the contacts form pits from the welding-like spark that takes place when the contacts separate.  Eventially the contacts are destroyed and the heater core fails to warm to the proper temperature.  It may never get warm or it may get too hot.

Be forewarned: heater elements which glow red hot can ignite hair and cloth fibers that get sucked into the heater and cause fires.  Shut the fan off and clean it thorough if you smell the oder of burning hair or other burning smells."

You can take a knife that's sort of sharp and get it to the next level with this strop.  I just wouldn't have predicted it.  So in terms of performance, I'd rate this at least a 4 star, maybe 5.  Why only 3 stars?  This is WAY overpriced.  You can get double sided, quality strops for about $20 and the green compound is like $5 for a huge block of the stuff.  Yes it takes some effort to ""load"" the leather, but if you look on youtube you'll find all kinds of tricks to make that work.  This strop should cost about $25.

However, this one has now stopped working as well, after only about 9 months or so.  I do not want the hassle of returning it for repair; will just throw it away.  It's a shame because it was a really nice flashlight while it worked.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"Unit is plastic and seems to be well made. It easily fits on top of a 5gal bucket, but does not snap on or fit tightly.  Only when the vac is running does it ""snug"" down for a tight fit.  So, it easily comes off when not in use, which is aggravating.  Also, when hoses are attached, you need to have the bucket anchored in some way or it will be falling over every time you move one of the hoses.  Once the bucket gets to be about half full, then it becomes more stable.  None of that is really the fault of the product though, but is a result of using the product.

I am not overly impressed with it, but it works for the intended purpose.  Plastic holes for hoses don't look like they can take much abuse, so we will see how it lasts over time.  For the money, it is a good buy."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"This is a good alternative if you don't want to drill into your bathroom tile or spend too much money on an all metal kit.  Just keep in mind that this kit utilizes plastic mounting hardware and significant effort is needed to adjust the height of the shower head holder with just your thumb - the holder is spring loaded and uses a very heavy duty spring (its the most durable part of the whole kit).  I wouldnt recommend this item to anyone with arthritis!  I promptly returned this kit and purchased an independent shower head holder that used a high quality suction cup.  With my disabilities, I needed to be able to maintain the shower head at a fixed position, just at a lower height.  Still, if you're in need of an affordable solution to an adjustable height shower head holder, this might be for you.  However, if you have arthritis, you may want to keep shopping."

I gave up on it, I have tried everything to adjust this saw right with zero luck. My Craftsman seemed to have more power too, mind you this saw has been around for 15yrs and was used pretty hard, I used it for all my junk cutting and I liked it better then the Rigid, so much I went to give it back and the guy and he told me he did not want it back, to throw it in the garbage.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"At first I thought I was getting a great deal, buying this dual switch for half the price of a Leviton one. But when I received it and checked out the rocker movement, I quickly concluded I got ripped off. The movement of the two switches is so flimsy and floppy, I can't image this thing will last anywhere close to my dead Leviton, which we had for nearly ten years before one of the rockers got jammed. While the rockers on this Baomain switch have some play in the ON direction and eventually require some effort to turn the switches on, in the OFF direction it takes very little effort to turn it off. When ON, only a slight tap causes the switch to turn OFF. I didn't bother wasting my time installing it, and instead went to my local hardware store and got a Leviton switch. Bummer, because I was very excited to save half off of my future switch purchases. Oh well; buyer be warned."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"I bought this in hopes that it would stay lit... after all, it is called ""Windfighter"". I followed the directions exactly. Well, I think they really need to change the name, because it kept blowing out today every time there was a slight breeze. I believe the design is the defect. Even bucket candles stay lit better than this -- the reason being that a bucket candle's wick is much lower. This ""Windfighter"" has a raised wick. And despite the metal top (that keeps falling off when you move or carry it, because it does not screw on or anything), the wind can just blow right through the holes and extinguish the flame. Another issue with this... when it was lit, it was producing some pretty heavy black soot/smoke. YUK! I can still feel it in my lungs! lol  I bought 3 of these, unfortunately, and feel like I wasted money, because I am going back to my old bucket candles that stay lit better and do not make black smoke."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"This could have been great. Unfortunately the most important feature is useless. The belt clip seems tight and springy, but put in your belt and it slips off with almost no effort. Someone suggested taping it, which is a poor (and ugly) fix. My solution was to drill through the metal clip and rivet it. Just insert a wooden block, drill through the clip, remove the block, insert a rivet from the inside, replace the block, add the cap and hammer it home. It doesn't interfere with the tool at all.

But, speaking of the tool - While this has become my fave for every day use, the CS4 has tools on the outside and they snag the case when you try to insert the tool. I have a Blast, which I use for work, and a Rebar, which lives in my wife's car. Both tools have their bladess mounted INSIDE the handles.

This is a 5 star item now that I've ""fixed"" it, but as it was, because it's so very easy to lose, 3 stars."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"Poorly made is about the only way to describe these. They are entirely plastic and its that very soft plastic that splits easily. I got them, mounted them up in the shop and flipped the switch. The one came on, the other I needed to use the pull chain for, however that's when I discovered their lack of quality. With the slightest pull on the pull chain the whole switch and bottom plate came off. In looking at where the screws go in, everyone of them was split. I took the other one down and examined it and it was in the same shape. I don't have time to mess with returning them and having a dark shop for a week or more while the replacements show up so I just drilled out where the screws go through and used small bolts, nuts and washers to mount the switch plate back on both of them. It won't come apart now, but I have doubts that these will even be functional in a years time with as cheap as they're made."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"All in all, it's a decent blade, gets the job done - cuts aluminum. It came nicely packaged in thick cardboard ""sleeve"", with clear tubing protecting the teeth. 5 stars for packaging.
At my place, it will be used now and then for thin aluminum angle and strips.
Cuts are not clean, I have to use a file to clean them up and smooth the edges. Were I a professional, this would have been unacceptable, but since I am not, I can live with it (for a while, till perfectionism gets the best of me).
In the past I've used one much more expensive aluminum-cutting blade. We're talking close to $100, and smaller diameter (between 7"" and 8"" -can't remember exactly). Now, THAT blade... The resulting cuts were immaculate, smooth-edged and shiny (not dull and ""barbed"" as with the blade being reviewed), and did not require any further finishing work.

THE BOTTOM LINE:
If you're a hobbyist like me, needing to make a dozen cuts once in a blue moon, then save your money and get it.
If you're a professional, invest into something of better quality."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"I was in love with this LED bulb until today when I took a multimeter to measure the current draw and calculated the wattage.  It turns out this bulb consumes about 8.0 Watts!!!  That's a far cry from the ""3.6 watts"" claimed on the package.

G7 Power no longer sells this bulb on their website and I wonder why.

This bulb was not the first to misrepresent the energy savings and won't be the last, but I'm just surprised at the big discrepancy.

CFL bulbs are the worst offenders when it comes to exaggerating the actual energy savings.

Some examples of the bulbs I have at home:

G7 Power ""3.6W"" vintage LED actually uses 8 watts.
A no-name ""23W"" CFL actually uses 43 watts
An Ecosmart ""14W"" CFL actually uses 24 watts
A Sylvania ""9W"" CFL actually uses 18 watts
A ""10.5W"" Philips LED bulb actually uses 21 watts.

Most LED bulbs I have are quite accurate in stating the watts, but there are clearly exceptions. The Cree bulbs I got are accurate in the stated vs. actual energy usage.  All my incandescent bulbs are very accurate in the stated energy usage."

After a lot of digging online, I found an obscure reference to that message pertaining to the failure of the heating element. It didn't seem very common, so I returned the iron and got a replacement. The replacement worked fine with very intermittent usage over the course of a few months. However, I needed to use the iron for a remote task recently. I put it in my toolbox along with some other tools. Upon reaching my destination and firing up the iron, I got the ""h-E"" message again!

I was left without the main tool I needed for the task on that Sunday. Left with few options, I went to Home Depot and picked up a cheap Weller. Lo and behold, the Weller got the job done, and the Hakko is out of commission again.

During the ~5 times that I was able to use the Hakko, I enjoyed its functionality. It just appears very delicate in my case. I wanted to love this well-respected iron, but I'm left with a dud yet again."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"There are some things I like about this product and some I do not.  As with most tools models, brands, quality, what the tool is being used, cost and other things make a buying decision.

This is not a top of the line model or and I wouldn't recommend it for heavy industrial use.  However, for home use or its intended use is light then this drill will work for you.  There is no need to spend lots of money on a professional model.

Everybody holds and uses the same tool differently.  I didn't really like the feel of the tool in my hand.  It just doesn't have a comfortable quality feel.  But then I prefer top of the line tools, they usually pay you back in useability, durability and quality of work.  But then this drill may be ok for you.  I really cannot say I had problems with the battery kicking out, but then that is me.

I put this tool somewhere in the middle for quality and cost.  Time will tell on the durability.  So I give it 3 stars."

I got it for evening walks with my dog and at first, I was really happy with it. It sheds a nice blue light and allows her to see where she's walking and, more importantly, allows passing cars to see both of us! It attached nicely to her collar.

Even before the clasp broke (in literally fewer than 10 uses), there were a couple issues--the light itself is very hard to turn on. I pressed both sides as hard as I could, and I ended up having to hit it against a wall to get the thing to turn on. Also, the clasp is difficult to get on a squirming dog. You'd think it would easily collapse so that you could slip it onto the collar...I don't want my dog wearing it all the time (just one more thing on her collar to jingle/get caught/etc.). But it's a hassle to get on. And yet, it broke after only a few uses!

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"I just finished installing this timer so can't comment on longevity yet. All my house fans are on timers but my previous Levitron timers are breaking after about 5 years. I'm hoping this Woods brand lasts longer.

As other reviewers have noted if you install according to instructions you end up with a gap between the switch cover plate and the timer. Perhaps there's no true standard but this Woods timer was off by a 1/4 inch!  I added washers to prop the timer out from the wall (trial and error) and got it flush. Thinking I was done I screwed in the switch plate only to discover the plate itself now wouldn't sit flush on the wall (because now the timer post was out from the wall. I thought I'd have to ""pick my gap"" so to speak.

I went to the extreme and ended up hack sawing the face cover plate screws in half (tricky). Now the timer and the switch plate fit snug with no gaps.

Way, way, too much futzing around to justify 4 or 5 stars from me. I can't help but think this timer has a design flaw."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"first, packaging was TERRIBLE. i know it's a large item, but it was put in two boxes (side to side) and taped with clear packaging tape. just for that they should get 2 stars. a kid would be able to package it better. just terrible.

- the edges always seem to have more paint left over than the middle. not sure if it's my roller or the design
- why is there a trough at the top? what's it for? maybe the brush, but i don't use it.
- holds a lot, easy to apply paint on the roller
- no liner available (that i know of), so it's a pain to clean up (see tip below)

one tip - leave more than a THIN film of paint when you are done, so that when it dries out, you can just peel it off in one swoop. if you try to get every last bit of paint, it's almost impossible to clean the next day (without water or solvents of course). when you don't see the green plastic and it dries out, it will be a piece of cake to take the latex paint off.

I thought maybe I needed new rechargeable batteries for the two that didn't work so I took the batteries out of the good ones and put them in the ones that didn't work-it still didn't work.

The reason I bought these tiki lights were because they looked really nice but my purchase experience was not too pleasant.  When the lights failed shortly after my purchase I thought that was that and therefore the one star review, however, the seller reached out to me to replace them.  I was very pleasantly surprised that this company stood behind their product.  I just received a new set today that they sent me just in time to enjoy the ambience in my backyard for the Fourth of July.  Although I gave the product a one star rating I give this company a 5 star rating for their excellent customer service."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"The box is not deep enough, large envelopes and magazines don't drop in the box, you have to pull down the handle to make it drop. The outgoing mail clip is made for #10 business envelopes and slightly larger, if you put a greeting card in there it is visible from the outside. The clip should be mounted on the side of the pull down drawer rather than the bottom to allow you to put larger envelopes in. The box comes with 12 1/2"" holes drilled in the bottom to allow for various mounting configurations, you are only going to use 4. The box should come with 12 plastic plugs to fill the holes not used. Mail boxes sit just 8"" from the curb which very often has water running in it. When the mail truck arrives he can very easily splash water into the mail box from the bottom. The locking door has a gap between it and the mailbox, very easy to insert a small crow bar and pry it open. Information with the box states for extra keys both blank and cut can be ordered online. Not true, you have to call the company for cut keys."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"I've switched many of the bulbs in my home to LEDs but unfortunately there are still some fixtures to which there is no LED equivalent bulb for, such as the 100W incandescent ones. I chose Philips bulbs because they generally produce high quality bulbs and such is the case with this CFL, unfortunately one of the downsides of CFLs is that they take time to warm up. This bulb turns on and looks to be about 60% of maximum brightness for about a minute. The gradual increase in brightness is slow enough you don't actually notice it, but once the bulb is warm you can turn it off and back on and it goes back to 100% brightness. The color representation is good and it is slightly brighter than the equivalent 100W incandescent bulb while only using about 1/4 of the energy. Since the cost is about 1/8th of a 60W equivalent bulb it's a good value proposition. 3/5 stars because it's not perfect and form factor is slightly larger than a traditional bulb so it doesn't fit in fixtures that use lamp shade harps. If Philips could make the size slightly smaller and make the warm up time better I'd give it another star."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"First thing I noticed is that the escutcheon *looks* nice with the nickel finish, but it is cheap plastic.  I have no doubt that after a few good cleanings, even the most modest of scrubbing pads would leave this looking awful.

Second thing is that it didn't even fit.  I'm replacing an original Moen trim kit.  My originial sits flush to the wall.  This one has about a 3.5"" ring that needs to be recessed into the wall by 1/4"" - not something easy to accomplish on an existing tile wall.  I have about a 2"" diameter hole where the valve comes out, but it's not big enough.  You can see what I'm talking about in the product picture - where the handle is attached, you can see that circle there and how it is recessed.

The one nice thing (not that it benefitted me at all) is that this kit tries to replace both old & new Moen configurations by providing several inserts to choose from.  This way you can match it to most Moens regardless of how your current one screws in to the valve.

I'm looking for a different kit that 1) sits flush and 2) might have a more durable faceplate."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"I received this tool as a gift. It is well made and very useful, especially with trim molding and almost anything that requires an angle on the sliding miter saw. However, the scale was misaligned by one full degree. I called Starrett and was told that their tolerance for this tool is +/- one degree. That is unacceptable from a company like Starrett renowned for their  precision. I exchanged the tool for another, hand selected from inventory, and found one just .1 degree misaligned after looking at a dozen or so. This is workable accuracy but IMO the tool should be engraved, and the scale should be accurate or the scale should be eliminated. The decal itself may be accurate but the application process seems to produce a fair number of these tools with misaligned scales. With a sliding miter saw this is not really a problem as you can just transfer the angle. But, if the scale is there it should be accurate or at least installed properly. With the scale accuracy problems it rates three stars. If the scale were properly installed and accurate, I would give it 5 stars. Then I would not have to use my engraved Starrett protractor to read the actual angle when needed."

UPDATE: After using these for a few nights, I discovered that two of them had moved on the hard hat. I don't know if it was the freezing temps outside, or the hot temps sitting on the dash in the truck. Whatever the reason, I had to replace the tape on one of them. The tape they use it not the same VHB tape that I have. And I have 3M VHB, right out of the box, that I have used for years, so I know mine is legit.) These are not good for hard hat use. Two Cons...The holders are flat. There really is no flat spot on a hard hat, so there will be a small space along the edge that will not adhere to the surface. Its why Go Pro makes curved helmet mounts. Its a big deal, because enough of the VHB tape does make contact. Also, the holders are two different sizes. There is no instruction as to which goes where. I placed the large ones toward the back of the hard hat, and I hope that is correct."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"It's all but impossible to get one of these that is not cloudy.  The wax formula used in these is not very good, and it doesn't take much shaking for it to diffuse into the water, making it so cloudy you can't see the wax blob at all.  It's pretty much a guarantee that it's going to be shaken during shipping and that you'll receive junk.

Upon contacting the manufacturer, they offered to send replacements over and over again, but no one would address the real problem:  Isn't something wrong with the product if you can't even ship it without it being destroyed?

For those stuck with these lamps, here is one DIY solution:  When the lamp is cold, very gently open the bottle cap on top with a tiny flat-head screw driver.  Loosen the teeth of the cap all the way around just enough to get the cap off.  Do not use a bottle opener, because it will bend the cap in the middle and you'll never get it to seal tightly again.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"I moved into a new house that had been built about a year before.  For the past 17 months I have been changing batteries very often in my three CO detectors.  I finally started putting dates on the batteries and found that they only last 2 months (1 month in a cold basement).  I'm guessing I spent about $70 in batteries.  The batteries are only there to kick in when the AC power fails, which it rarely does and never for very long.  However, my tests indicate that the batteries are being drained while the AC power is properly working.

I contacted the company for warranty replacements and was told I would have to pay $20 for shipping & HANDLING to get my ""FREE"" warranty replacements.  I made a big stink and got them to send them at their expense.  Only time will tell if the replacements work.  Till then I can work on the problem of random beeps from my BRK smoke detectors.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"I ultimately ended up sending these back.  Here's why...

In my last home, I outfitted everything with GE Reveal bulbs.  It's the best light there is in my opinion and I wanted a similar look in my new home but wanted to make the switch over to LED everywhere.  I figured daylight would be the best solution so I bought these.  Wrong.  It's on the higher spectrum of daylight and really makes everything look pale/grey-bluish. I didn't care for the color at all and only realized after some research that there's more to the color temp that makes the Reveal bulb so good.  Anyway, I changed it out for a warm white which although slightly yellow is more pleasing than the harsh color of these.  I just wish someone would sell a 4200k bulb which would be ideal.

In comparison to a standard halogen, the heat difference is noticeable.  These are nowhere near as hot and should save me in the end in regards to power bills.  Although the spread is listed at 45 degrees, I feel halogen bulbs were a little wider just from the nature of the bulb.  These seem very focused at 45 degrees so the kitchen doesn't seem quite as bright as with the halogens.  Overall, I pleased enough to stick with the LED change."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"Bought this for use on the fire dept as an emergency back up tool. You never know when you are going to have to cut something quick and this seemed to fit the bill. Used to carry a pocket clip style knife (Kershaw) but wanted a razor sharp tool and figured you couldn't get any sharper than an actual razor. I wanted this to be able to cut sheet rock or a seat belt in an emergency situation and standard cardboard boxes around the station . I've had this for many months now it is just not ""cutting it"" The build seems great at first, this thing is really heavy. Unfortunately the build is not that great. The quick release mechanism is already slipping and it doesn't close properly. It feels like its going to break soon. I have actually put this to use maybe a couple dozen times since I received it. (not a whole lot) For the price I thought I was getting a deal but you really do get what you pay for. I compared mine to others who carry the folding box cutters at my station and although my Sheffield looks way better than any of theirs the functionality is not up to par. If you need an occasional junk drawer blade this will work fine. If you are looking for a ""worker"" knife keep looking."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"We put this in when we renovated our kitchen wanting to have the newest neato tech.  It would work fine for a couple months and then go on the fritz, either not responding at all or randomly turning on when nobody was in the room.  I am pretty handy, I have dissembled, cleaned, and reassembled it several times now but it never lasts for long.  The whole system is based on the fact that when you touch it you ground it out, yet there are numerous components below the sink that are not insulated, and if they happen to touch something conductive (like, oh, I don't know, a PIPE?) it renders it useless or triggers it when nobody is around.  I went through several iterations of mounting the batteries up and away, insulating the pipes to prevent the hose/weight from touching etc all to no avail.  In addition, the soap dispenser that came with it is plastic crap, it's not even metal, just a facade that looks like metal, it broke within a few months.  Delta replaced that part, but still, do you expect a $300+ faucet set to break in 3 months?  I'm sure the Delta engineers would love to blame this on faulty install or an inept homeowner, but the fact is the product is not designed to handle anything but perfect conditions, and real life never is."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"Installation should be a fairly easy matter if you are replacing compatible hardware.
BUT, if you're replacing Weiser deadbolts, you may be out of luck.
That's what I discovered when I tried to install the Kwikset Smartcode 915 on our front door. I struggled mightily for a couple of hours trying to figure out what I was doing wrong before I finally concluded that when the contractor who built my house installed the Weiser deadbolts, it involved drilling a hole for the latch mechanism just a smidge too low to match up with the Kwikset hardware. It's close, maddeningly close, but there is no way I could make it work.
Just to be sure, I attempted to install the Kwikset deadbolt on a similar door connecting our back hallway with the garage. And the result was exactly the same.
If I want to use the Kwikset hardware, I'll have to enlarge one of the two holes in the door - the one for the latch or the one for the locking mechanism. Or, I suppose, I could buy a new door and start from scratch. None of these options seem worth the effort.
Other than the fact that I can't readily install it, this is a very cool product and I was looking forward to having it on my front door.
I'll hang onto it in case I find a compatible door someday, but buyers should be aware that it's not an easy replacement for Weiser deadbolts."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"I have kinda a love/hate relationship with these flashlights. I love that they are super affordable and you get three flashlights. They are plastic, not aluminum, but the tolerances seem tight and they appear relatively water resistant. I left the floodlight on last night and after 4-1/2 hours the light intensity was down to about 25%, but still usable.

The non-focusing flashlight produces a tight, bright beam that easily illuminates objects 50-75 feet away. The light bar floodlight works great for close up work or will light half a room bright enough to read. The rubberized flat black exterior is nice and ""grippy."" The magnet is sufficient to hold the light vertically or horizontally on smooth sheet metal.

Ugly? Oh, man I so wish they provided directions on how to open these suckers up to insert the batteries! (3 AAA--not included) TIP: half the textured base near the magnet (opposite the on/off switch) slides open. There is a faint black arrow at the opening.

The bad? These lights have three settings--flashlight, floodlight and flashing red LED lights. Two of my flashlights worked perfectly, but the flashing red LED's never worked on the third. No biggie and I'm keeping them all, but it bodes ill for the reliability.

Still, these things are so cheap I can't complain--much.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"I found the Blair (BLR13224) 3/8 in. Double End Spotweld Cutters to be very aggressive. The first one bit in, snapped one of the four teeth right off. I have no clue what broke it. The second one worked for a minute or so and then did the same. So far the third one is going and cut and removed about two dozen spot welds, but is noticeably becoming worn down. The initial aggressiveness has worn off.

For the money... I have found better spot weld bits and will most likely not reorder these as they definitely don't last as I expected. Sorry, but facts are facts. I'm not that impressed. As I mentioned in the review under ""Blair (BLR13224) 3/8 in. Double End Spotweld Cutter in Blister Pack"", the bits were extremely difficult to remove remove from the #13216 Arbor/Retractable Pilot threaded shaft. I had to resort to putting the arbor into a vice, clamping it down, TIGHT, and removing the bit with a pair of vice grips. The threads are common right handed threads so there should be no doubt one would remove the bit in a left handed motion. Every time I removed a bit, same thing. This is caused by the right handed direction the bit turns when removing spot welds. Understandable, but they really become torqued in place.

Sorry for the negative review, but Facts are Facts! When they cut, they cut. But why make this kind of work more difficult than it needs to be. At the cost??? Well, I'll let you be the judge."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"Of the three Tunable White BR30 bulbs I bought three months ago, one is already dead.  (That's a really, really short life for an LED bulb!)

Even before that, there were a couple of flaws that really bothered me:

- Apparently, you can set the default color temperature if, and only if, you have the Sylvania hub.  I don't have the Sylvania hub; I'm using SmartThings.  With SmartThings, I'm stuck with 2700k lights (at initial power delivery); we wanted something closer to 6500k.  I don't really want to purchase a new, dedicated hub for a one-time settings pressing.  (This is absolutely a preference thing, but feel like there ought to be some other way to do this; you shouldn't have to buy a hub for a one-time use if they're going to tout compatibility with another hub!)

- Pairing mode is too easily triggered.  I have a toddler and on multiple occasions now, she's managed to put the bulbs back into pairing mode (which unpairs them from our hub).  GE Link bulbs' pairing process was an absolute pain, but we never accidentally triggered pairing with a few off/on toggles like we have with the Sylvania bulbs.

- The dimmest setting isn't as dim as Hue or LIFX bulbs (but seems to be on par with GE Link and Sengled).

- SmartThings Routines that trigger changes to brightness and color temperature sometimes only do one or the other.

Two of the three bulbs still work, but we're not really using them as smart, tunable bulbs because of the flaws listed above."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"Understanding that all wax seals will eventually fail, I researched the alternatives and purchased this Danco seal and a Fluidmaster rubber seal - in case one didn't work properly. The toilet it was to be used with is about a year old and is from the American Standard ""Mainstream"" family.

The floor is tiled and level. The toilet flange is the newest PVC flange that Oatey makes, is ""above the floor"", and level.

The specs on this Danco seal state that it will work with flanges that are ""above the floor"", up to 1/2"" tall.

This seal didn't compress enough to allow the toilet to sit flush with the floor. It just rocked side to side. There was no error with the installation as the toilet was repositioned several times to ensure that a proper ""set down"" onto the Seal was made. There just simply wasn't enough room between the outlet on the bottom of the toilet and the top of the flange for this Seal to fit into.

You know what worked? The cheapie old Harvey wax ring. Prepped and placed the toilet down the first time and flush the toilet sits.

Maybe this Danco Seal works for some combinations of toilets and flange heights - but if you want to save yourself some grief, purchase and have on hand the good ole' wax ring just in case you're in the predicament I was in.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"This could potentially be an outstanding tool, but for a few unfortunate short-cuts and oversights.
Short-cut: detachable legs, designed no doubt to ship in a smaller box and possibly save manufacture expense.  My saw rocks back and forth across two opposite corners because my legs are not straight.  An accurately cast one-piece base would solve this.
Short-cut: cheesy plastic clamps that are awkward to use because the holes in the clamping tensioner through which the clamp rods pass do not align easily, and because in the angle-clamp mode the second part of the tensioner assembly that allows use at an angle does not attach to the main tensioner, but rather aligns loosely, requiring something of a juggling act to assemble the three items for angle-use.
Oversight: the clamp is not usable in its normal configuration (through the back, in the v-slot on the bed) for thinner narrow stock laid flat to miter cut because the clamping foot won't rotate far enough down.
Short-cut: mysteriously, the manufacturer takes the time to give a tutorial on geometry required to lay out angles for frames/boxes that are regular polygons, and even gives tips on saw usage, but provides crappy wordless diagrams for most of the assembly of the tool (which is not totally intuitive and takes a little keen observation to pull off.)  Annoying.

I want to note that the vendor I bought from (they sell through Amazon, so this is appropriate to mention), The Best Things, is a good company and I would not hesitate to give them my business.  But I cannot recommend the Nobex saw."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"I have my chains sharpened professionally when they begin to cut crooked due to uneven wear.  Otherwise, I touch them myself as soon as they fail to cut uniform shavings.  This usually occurs after about an hour of cutting hardwoods or two hours of softwoods.  If the bar gets into the dirt or you hit a nail you will be sharpening even sooner.  You can either carry several chains to get you through the day or be prepared to touch them up on the bar.

I prefer to touch up my own chains because the saw shops usually take off about 2MM of steel when they sharpen.  At that rate, a chain does not last very long.  If you touch up your own chains when they first begin to dull, you will only take off a few thousandths of an inch.

This tool works well if you gauge the grinder off of the tooth as described in some of the other posts.  The problem is powering the grinder while in the field.  Cordless grinders don't hold a charge very long so you need to carry extra batteries.  Corded grinders need a place to be plugged in.  Either solution limits you mobility.

I prefer the ""Oregon"" brand file and gauge.  No electricity required and it easily goes in your thigh pocket or field kit.  Only one or two strokes per tooth needed for a touch-up and you are back to work.  The gauge make it easy for even a neophyte to maintain proper tooth shape and depth."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"I have had this saw for a number of years. I am primarily a carpenter but dabble in a lot of crafts for the sake of expediency and simply out of acquiring a skill in a variety of types of work.  If I had it to do over again I would not buy a bridge-type saw. The concept seems good but in reality, the design just doesn't provide the kind of sawing control needed to cut tile accurately.  The blade cannot be moved smoothly across tile the way it can on saws where the blade remains fixed and the bed holding the material moves INTO the blade.

The slated fixed aluminum base also creates a rather slippery platform for wet tile. Some type of backstop to prevent the material from shifting is needed and the inferior design and cheaply built T-square provided just isn't adequate.  It simply does not provide adequate control of the cutting process.

You would think that the extended length of the box like construction would provide ample space for long cuts on larger tiles but the bridge arms are inevitably in the way of most cutsforget doing diagonal cuts on larger tiles.

Besides an inferior design, the unit is cheaply made with poor welds and rough finishes that do not hold up well. The water reservoir and pump produces a sloppy mess that can be generally be avoided with other style saws.  The motor is also a bit underpowered but nonetheless has continued to run with regular use.

Don't let the quirky design lure you in. Look to more basic type tile saws."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"Nice packaging, and great communication from the seller. However, I wasn't pleased with the product itself. I ordered 9 of these bulbs and installed them in 3 ceiling fans in 3 different rooms. So this is not a review about a fluke bulb. First off, they have a delay when turning on. It's subtle, but it's there. I confirmed this by mixing other LED bulbs in a ceiling fan with one of these. These turn on a split second behind the other ones that are immediate on. Second, the color is very blue. I have many 5000k LED bulbs throughout my house. Base styles include: BR30, A19, E12 and G9. All of the other 5000k bulbs simulate (to me) natural daylight. These, however, have a much bluer tone to them. I've recently read that the blue in LED lights make people not be able to fall asleep. So, probably not the best for a bedroom. Aside from that, though, it wasn't a desirable color. Third, while I don't see a flicker while staring at the light, the room itself had a subtle disburance when these were on. With it dark outside, and only these lights being on, the room had a flutter to it. Sort of gave me a headache. Fourth, and last, these aren't very bright. All of my other 60w (equivalent) LED bulbs almost seem too bright at times. These, on the other hand, weren't bright enough. Three 60w bulbs in the ceiling fan of a 9x11 bedroom should be ample (It is with the incandescent bulbs), but with these it wasn't bright enough to read."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"I wanted to replace my living room lamps and these seemed perfect.  I ordered 2, but they didn't put out quite enough light to replace regular lamps.  They were super cool and I immediately got great comments on them.  I bought a third lamp immediately to brighten the room... and because I liked them so much.  All arrived in perfect condition and after a few months, I've still had no quality issues.  They perform as advertised.

They come with 2 serious down sides.  First, they take PLANNING if you plan to use them to effect.  They take about 7 hours to heat up enough to start flowing.  While heating, the lava doesn't really move.  Instead, they look like weird alien fetuses in lab jars.  I entertain a lot and always need to remember to turn them on by noon if I'm having guests that night.  Second, they are major energy hogs.  At 200 watts each, I'm running 600 watts of power for about 15 hours a day when I use them.  This irks me because the rest of my home is super energy efficient and I use LED lights whenever possible.  You gotta pay to play!

Overall, everyone loves them, and I do to.  But, I think one would have been a good accent, where 3 are a bit overkill and don't really put out enough light for anything other than ambiance.  I'll most likely split them up soon, putting them in different rooms so I don't have to use all 3 at once.

Now you really don't need a ton of instructions if you know in general what you are doing. But seriously, no instructions on their website? What is this 1998?
As far as the product it looks good when you are done, but there are some issues.
-The returns fit inside the rails and they recommend using silicone to glue them in place. They sit pretty far out from the wall which sort of defeats the purpose. ( they are to keep from people catching clothing or other things over the railing and that causing a fall) the returns stood out I would say 3/4 of an inch. (I should have measured but did not)
-They are hard to get to fit nice and tight against the pipe. This goes about 2x for the knuckle joint if you use that I used wide masking tape to hold them in place.
- The email I received in response to my request for install specs or instructions was a zip file that contained a virus according to Yahoo mail.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"The work light work OK so far. It charges via USB charger (they include both wall and car chargers). The charging port does not have a cover, so I am afraid it will get dirty or wet and it will prove fatal for the light.

The three moving lights can either be folded along the main body of the flashlight, or they can be spread out, but they cannot be brought up more than 90 degrees to the surface and cannot concentrate all four lights on one spot. I found it irritating, especially in tight spaces, where it would be nice to fold one of the sides more to the center to fit in a light corner. The magnet is strong enough to hold the flashlight horizontally, but just barely - it is very easy to knock it down.

The battery life was relatively good so far, and it charges rather fast, too. When the battery gets low, it turns off without any notice. You can turn it on again for a few seconds to find a charger. It does not charge and light up at the same time - if you plug it in and turn on, it will not be charging at all. Empty battery will stay empty battery.

The most irritating thing is that it has one button for multiple modes. When you first turn it on, it only lights up the end, as a regular flashlight. But when you are done, and want to turn it off and press the button, it lights up the three sides, effectively blinding you, unless you unfold the sides and direct them away. It needs on power button and one mode button."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"Bidets are awesome so this review is not a statement of the usefulness of a bidet.  Those of us who have visited Japan come back with an attitude of ""what have I been thinking trying to clean myself with a dry tissue?""  When you find a good bidet you'll never want to use anything else.

I took off one star for each of the three problems I found with this product:

Problem #1:  The product fit the mounting holes fine, as the pre-measurement assured it would.  The problem was the how the seat closed.  The back of our existing toilet seat interfered slightly with the top of the bidet.  This bent the nozzle back out of vertical position, causing the water stream out between users legs and onto the floor.  There was no mention in product description of pre-measuring the seat for this issue.

Problem #2:  There is no pressure adjustment.  Our house is new construction so the water pressure is great, about 75 psi.  Ouch.  Yes I can open the valve slightly to compensate but the valve is sensitive so there were many ouch moments.

Problem #3:  As you see from many other comments, the bidet causes a big gap in the front of the toilet seat.  Options are to ignore this (I think most positive reviewers are doing this), buy shims to fill the gap, or....buy a different product.  I built a nice house and it looks quite unprofessional to have a toilet seat with a 2-3"" gap in the front.  The gap on our toilet seat was greater than other reviewers due to problem #1 (see pic)."

Which means you can't wait for shipping or shop price, you head to the hardware store and pay top buck. After numerous Wayne pump float switches died (usually just after the warranty expires)I saw this one with the Switch Genius technology. At 3/4 HP it was more pump than I needed and it was the most expensive sump pump I ever bought. But I figured if the switch was more reliable than float switches the piece of mind would be worth the money.

I noticed the switch cycles the pump on early and shuts off only after sucking air for 10 - 15 seconds. After some severe storms a few weeks later I came home from work and could smell something hot. The pump wasn't turning off and was hotter than blazes! After following the manual and cleaning off the sensor it still wouldn't shut off. After unplugging the pump for half an hour or so it appeared to work normally again. Every time there's a storm I have trouble with the water sensor not shutting off the pump. Wayne says to send it back for a replacement on my dime. It weighs a ton and is going to be expensive to ship. Plus, what do I do for a pump while there's two in transit?

I had a Zoeller pump for over ten years with no problems until the switch died. I had to go with Waynes because that's what the hardware store carried and like I said, when you need a replacement you usually need it in a hurry. I've gone through 5 Wayne pumps in 6 years, this will be the last."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"Only needing a CO detector in one room, I don't think these combo CO/smoke detectors are a very good idea.  (Maybe if I needed a lot of CO detectors I would, however.)  Make sure you save the directions, as well as memorize how many horn beeps there are for smoke and how many there are for carbon monoxide.  Also, the directions make it seem like there is a smoke LED and a CO LED, when there is only one for both.  In addition, you are not suppose to need to replace the batteries during the 10-year-life of the detector, since it has ""sealed, ten year lithium batteries"", yet the directions state there is a ""low battery chirp"" and tells you to install ""2 new AA batteries"" if that chirping happens?!  (Can you or can you not replace the batteries without deactivating the detector?)  Moreover, if you end up having to deactivate the detector for any reason, it becomes that week's trash.  (Only, you can't throw it in the trash.)  Finally, the directions say to test the detector once a week!  (Yeah, sure, especially if you have a lot of them.)  I don't think 10-year detectors are a good idea at all.  If you are required by law to have them, my sympathy to you.  For anyone wanting a CO detector by itself, I highly recommend the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/First-Alert-CO615-Dual-Power-Carbon-Monoxide-Plug-In-Alarm-with-Battery-Backup-and-Digital-Display/dp/B000Q5VMKG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">First Alert CO615 Dual Power Carbon Monoxide Plug-In Alarm with Battery Backup and Digital Display</a>, and there are plenty of decent smoke detectors out there that don't last 10 years. You will be far safer, in my opinion, with a dedicated CO detector like the CO615, and and a non-10-year smoke detector."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"This would be great if I wasn't going to be home and wanted lights going on and off at various times during the day and night. But what I want to use it for is to run a water distiller for exactly 5 hrs. The other type of timer was not accurate. This one is, but each time I want to run it, I have to set the time to go on and then off and verify the day and the schedule. The next day always at a different time than the previous day, when I want to run the distiller for five hours, I have to set the timer again as to what time it should go on and then off and also set the day for it to run and whether it should repeat everyday, every other day etc...all settings that are insignificant to me.

I wish I could just set to run for five hours and have it turn off afterwards. It was a lot of money to pay for for what I needed: a simpler setup. I am sure it is great for turning lights on and off randomly, as it says it does.

I have it plugged in an outlet under a wall cabinet which has a light under it but I have to use a flashlight to view the digital screen. It protrudes beyond where the light can shine on it.

When setting the times, if you go past the number you wanted, you cannot reverse it, but have to go all the way around the 12 hrs to get back to the number you wanted. This goes for hours and minutes, days of the week etc, for each of the on and off settings. Kind of a hassle. Anyone know of a simpler timer?"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,I purchased the MM 520 because it seemed like a reputable company one year ago.  I was so wrong.  from the day of purchase nothing but problems.  This things been out of commission over 8 months out of a year I had it.  Every time I call them they make you test everything.  It's a good thing I know how to use an electric meter and have one around. After going through loops every single time they want the board sent back to them.  On the phone they tell you they will get one sent back to me in 5 days but it always takes about a month. Their constant excuses is they are under staffed.....  last time I had issue was due to constant beeping.  They wanted me to send back the unit back to get me another master board. well they sent me one but it did not work.  Then they wanted me to send them the arm and the board which I did.  Called them after three weeks of waiting and they tell me there is no board that came with the arm.  WHAT??????  So finally got it back after two months and it had a slave board instead of the master board.  that's not all. I get a package from them about a month ago with someone else control board and battery.  I have never dealt with such unknowledgeable support and disorganized company in my life.  What a joke.  DO NOT buy this product or any other product from this company.  Unless you enjoy paying over a grand for the product and accessories so you can open the gate by hand 70% of the time.  What a joke......
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"As some of the other reviewers has stated, this is definitely a version 1.0 product.  I'm on an Android phone and the app is missing the ability to view the camera remotely. You can't simply use the Skybell app to see if everything is OK at the door.  The motion detection doesn't work, and you have to press the door bell before it'll send you an alert.  This was supposed to be working when they shipped.  I emailed them directly to check before ordering.

The Android app is crashing when you try to configure some things.  Android tablets are not all supported so you can't use all your mobile devices inside your home to view the Skybell activity. I have an Acer and the app will not install on the device. This is limiting as you always have to have your phone near you.  Hope they fix this soon.

I had my WiFi access point configured for N-Only as I do not have older 802.11b/g devices.  It never connected to the 2.4Ghz N-Only radio.  I had to go back into the WiFi AP and reconfigure to support the older 802.11b/g devices.  It says it's N compatible, but looks like it may not be.  This delayed the install procedure as I tried 5 times to get the device connected to the WiFi before taking a look at the WiFi AP settings.  So if you're having problems connecting it to your WiFi, double check this setting.

I think the concept is a really great idea and hopefully these items are simply version 1.0 growing pains.  Wait a few months for the product to mature.  If they can get the rest of the features in and fix the app bugs, it'll be a cool product."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"Light looks okay, a bit heavy for a AA size. Uses the switch to alternate between low and high. Low is too dim to be useful and the high is a WIDE Flood, not as bright as advertised.  My Fenix E21 is better on low and high is brighter at 150 lumens!  I'll stay with a Fenix E21 for an EDC light, or the Streamlight JR LED at 85 lumens.

UPDATE: April 2013, Getting ready to throw out the light, just thought I'd try something new. My new EDC lights are FENIX E11, one AA battery, 115 lumen high and 38 lumen low. Until reading some reviews, I'd have never known about 14500 batteries (AA size, just 3.7 volt, not 1.2 volt of normal AA battery.) For nearly 5 months I have been using 14500 battery in the E11, WOW! Nearly triples the light output, low is 200+ lumens, high near 300... Also, in reading, DO NOT USE TWO IN A 2 AA LIGHT!

But, there are some light manufacturers recommending a single 14500 and a dummy cell in a 2 AA light (All this depends on the LED quality, do the homework! I DID..)

In the Lightstar 300, output was only 140-150 lumens on the AA's. I've added one 14500 to one AA and VIOLA! A real tactical light!! Just over 300 lumens on high and 45-50 on low.  This is without testing equip., just comparison to other lights that are accurately measured by the makers.

Two points: 1. The warranty is voided.  and 2. Accidents may occur, use at your own risk.

Read the manfacturers LED parameters, the operating voltage is a good measure of possible use. I now have a Lightstar 300 that acts like a 300, no telling what the runtime is.  Still a one star light on AA batteries."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"This doorbell system has a LOT of potential.  What I've found, though, is that it does NOT seem to like cold weather.  I went through two sets of batteries in two months.  I learned and bought a large set of batteries through Amazon to accommodate the cold weather months (I live at 5,000 feet elevation).  Customer service is EXTREMELY prompt and courteous.  After my first doorbell transmitter blew through a set of batteries in under a month, they replaced the unit.  The second unit's battery door doesn't shut all the way and I had to tape it shut.  In 'normal' temperatures, it seems to be fine.  But when the battery starts to go bad, the doorbell will go off on its own randomly, many times in a short span of time.  There is no other way to tell if the battery is dying, other than that or missing guests :(  I'm going to keep using this system, though, knowing what I know about it.  The price is unbeatable, you get what you pay for, and I'm sincerely hopeful that they can improve the design for future models, because the chimes are fine (I use the default 'ding-dong, ding-dong' one) and I'm alerted to guests in a building out behind my home where I cannot otherwise monitor the front door.  NOTE: because this doesn't exactly look like a doorbell to guests, I applied a printed label that I made with my label printer (black text on yellow tape) that says ""DOORBELL"" on it and applied it to the surface of the transmitter to alert people to the bell.  Guests verified that my label alerted them to the existence of a doorbell as they would otherwise not have known I had one because it blends in to the white paint on my house."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"Ok thid is garbage plain and simple.  My brother brought one of these sinks and it does have a hairline crack at the base.  However what struck me as horrid is the thin walls of this sink make it as fragile as a china tea cup. It's pretty enough but its walls are so thin the sink is lucky to last a year without a major failure. If you are John Q Perfect and never drop anything or have any bathroom mishaps this sink is for you.  If you are like most of us and are less than perfect in the bathroom please buy another sink.  While pretty this sink is as thin as the sides of a mug.

I see they are not asking much for this sink which is a releaif because in this case you are getting what you pay for.  This sink looks alot like a quality Porcher sink that I purchased here on Amazon.com.  the construction of my Porcher sink was first rate. The walls were thick fireclay construction.  The porcher sink was made from very hard fire clay and looked alot like this.  Key difference the Porcher sink cost me $600 and will likely last the rest of my life.  I brought two for my bathroom and they still look great.

This sink does look good IF you are lucky enough to get one that does not have tiny hairline cracks.  Often to see the cracks youo must look for them using a very bright light source  The sink is so thin I'm not surprised it has a cracking problem.  Vitrious China sinks are more brittle than fire clay anyway but when you design or but a china sink like this one that is built with sides and a base this thin I think you are asking for trouble."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"This is a very bright light that is marred by an oversimplified design on the elastic cord that hold the lights in place. But let's start at the beginning. This is a very nice Energizer headset that could have been a lot better except for American corporate insistence on not quite getting things as well as they might have.  They list their light at 150 lumens, which is respectable and serviceable, but certainly not one of the  brightest headsets on the markets. They claim to have made a technological adjustment that makes this four times brighter. But they aren't clear about this. If this is four times brighter, that would mean it is a 600 lumens. If it is 600 lumens, then why not say it? I suspect because it really is just a 150 lumens headset, but they want you to think it is rather more. Regardless, this bright enough for most lighting needs. Where it fails is the headband. I have a couple of other headlamps, and in both instances they constructed the headset with several pieces of elastic. This allows for a couple of things. It provides a more stable perch on the head, which it most certainly provides. It also provides a more comfortable perch for the headlamp. This is simply not a very comfortable headset to wear. The lone band really cuts into your skin when holding it. If you tried to wear this on your head  for any length of time you would begin to experience discomfort and most probably a pressure headache.

This is not a bad headlamp, but there are much better ones available for just about any need. I'm something of an Energizer/Duracel loyalist (I find the two brands to be almost indistinguishable from one another and I will continue to use both this and Duracel products, but this isn't one of Energizer's stronger products."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"Summary: I bought the light in October. I had it until November, then it broke. I got a replacement in April after a dozen emails or so. The light was pretty nice though.

The light itself is really nice: small, powerful, nice-looking, exactly what I wanted. The accessories are good too. But don't be fooled by the 5 year warranty, unless you are ok with waiting for several months for a replacement.

The light stopped working shortly after the 30 day return period. No worries, I thought, I have 5 years of warranty from Olight, no problems at all. I contacted them, this is what happened.

10/08/2015: I ordered the light from Amazon.
11/16/2015: The light broke. I contacted them. They told me to unscrew the tail cap, disassemble and reassemble it and try again. That did not work.
11/19/2015: They told me that they'd send me a new tail cap.
11/23/2015: I received the new tail cap. That did not work either.
11/25/2015: They assigned me a RMA number and told me to mail the light in (at my expense). I did that.
12/09/2015: They received the light (according to USPS tracking).
01/19/2015: I contacted them asking what was going on. They told me that they mailed it back to the factory and that I should get it back ""soon"".
02/26/2015: I contacted them again, asking what was going on. They told me that they're sorry and that their usual turnaround time is 1-2 months.
03/29/2015: I contacted them again. They replied immediately and told me that the shipping was lost and that the light was discontinued. They offered me a free S30RII Baton, R20 Javelot or S2 Baton. The S30RII and the R20 are both more expensive than the light I originally purchased, and the S2 is about the same. I chose the S2 nevertheless because the S30RII and R20 are significantly larger than the S20R that I originally bought.
About a week later: I received the light."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"The construction of this Mag-Lite Solitaire is really quite good.  It's very sturdy and I've had one run over by my truck and had a 150 pound (68kg) Television drop on another without much visible damage (scratches).

I have received this as a gift and as a corporate tchotchke as well as having bought one and they do come in handy.  The problem is that it runs through batteries pretty quickly if you use this for anything more than looking for your keys on the ground or the deadbolt on your door when you forgot to leave on the porch light.  The lens cap tends to turn itself on in your pocket or bag... draining away the power.  I haven't ever used it as a keychain device as I don't like a lot of bulk.

I haven't ever experienced the reported problem with the end cap loosening.  The best task I've found for this light is to hang it on the keyring holder in my laptop bag.  It's simply not well suited to a pocket or to a keychain, and I believe that was its intended purpose.

I found the light, itself, to be fairly bright at full power, but with a more robust LED, it would probably be a better unit.  It does have a better light distance than an LED would produce, though.  All-in-all, a bit of a miss, but I'm a flashlight hound, so I still like it.  If you are looking for a good keyring light, get a smaller LED with an on/off switch.  This would probably make a good light for a purse or in a glove compartment.  I would recommend pairing it with a Lithium Battery (Technuity L92BP4 Battery, Lithium Aaa Photo Battery for example) - especially if storing in car or bag for long periods.  Make sure you tighten the lenscap well so it doesn't accidentally turn on."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"Considering how ancient the unit was that this replaced, a life of 2 years was a disappointment.  The company that installed it for Loews didn't repair them so we called another service.  The following is what I was told and I have no way of verifying if this was the straight scoop or BS.  The circuit control board was bad.  Probably for the following reason:  the track for the chain was in sections and vibrated when the door opened or closed and this transmitted to the motor unit and caused the board to fail.  The choices were: either order a new board, wait for it to arrive and pay for a second service call, or install a new unit.  We bought a new Guardian Model 628 with belt drive and a solid track that the tech just happened to have on the truck.  The technician pointed out that the door rollers were solid plastic and the black marks on the door tracks were where the plastic skidded and didn't roll and he had teflon rollers with ball bearings that were much better.  Several hundred dollars later I have to say 1) the belt drive unit is much smoother than the chain drive, and 2) the door, when pushed by hand, goes up and down with much less effort due to the ball bearing rollers.  I have no idea if what the tech explained to me was true, but the result is very good, if pricey.  None of this was expressed when I bought the unit so you might ask about chain drive vs belt drive - at the time I was told it was a question of noise, but no question the belt drive is smoother.  I was not offered a choice of ball bearings on the door rollers and I do think that bearing rollers are a good option if they offer it."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"I bought this to mount Board Buddies on my Dewalt-744 table saw.  The saw has a 19.5"" fence, so I had to cut the aluminum slide on both ends with a hack saw so that the wood screw holes would be centered over an auxiliary wooden fence a.k.a feather board that I made.  The saw's aluminum fence is 1"" wide with screws on its back side away from the blade.  I had to replace the Dewalt screws with equivalent 2"" sheet metal screws to attach the featherboards.  I made the wooden fence out of two pieces of 3/4"" hickory so that it would be hammer-handle tough.  I needed two pieces to make the fence wide enough to take wood screws from the slider as it is 2 1/4"" wide.  The holes for the wood screws in the slider are set 1 3/4"" from the edge.  Ideally, one would make the featherboard out of one piece that is 1 1/4"" thick, but good luck trying to find some.

All went well until I had to screw the aliminum slide onto the auxilary wooden fence.  I drilled deep pilot holes.  But, two of the brass-colored wood screws provided with the slide snapped off when the screws got deep into the wood.  The first time it happened, I was able to recover by separating the two hickory boards and unscrew the stub because the screws fell exactly between the featherboards.  Then I decided to glue the boards together so that the screws would be more secure.  On my second attempt to mount the slider, a second wood screw snapped.  This one was much more difficult to extract.  I had to use a hand grinder to dig a pit around the stub so that I could get a lock wrench on it.

MY ADVICE:  use the stainless steel wood screws that are supplied with the Board Buddies instead of the cheap brass-colored screws that come with the slider."

I did love the way it will stay in the spray mode, you don't have to keep pulling down on the fitting to move it from solid flow to spray time after time like you do with all the others on the market.  Yes its swivel hips moved smoothly as the gears in a great engine, the twelve hours I owned that is.

BUT
- lot of good it did to have all of the nice features when all of it disassembled and bounded across the room.  I tried repeatedly to re-seat it but things kept getting worse.  With the upper fitting being totally plastic every time you grip it especially with pliers its soft threads (whether you protect it with a rag or not) get more misshapen and you can forget ever getting it back to working order if this happens to you.

I had never had one come apart like this.  I didn't even know that the insert which you screw to the faucet was also threaded at the bottom and connects in screw fashion to the swivel element too.  I assumed that area was soldered or otherwise adhered.  Well in this Moen it was just threaded on so when the threads came undone they came undone in two places.... the upper end toward the faucet  and toward the bottom piece!  Ka Boom!"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,negative,truthful,"I purchased this nailer after my Dewalt 18v finish nailer decided to take a vacation. I install doors for a living, and needed a nailer with enough stank behind it to countersink nails through 5/4 material. I almost purchased a new Dewalt but this Ryobi had decent reviews, a comparable warranty, but a much better price point. All of my hand tools are Ryobi so I had more than enough batteries/chargers on hand. My experience with Ryobi tools has been a positive one. I'm extremely rough on my equipment, and they have all held up to the beating. Anyway, this nailer is OK. If you're using it for the occasional project, and don't mind having a few floating nails, it'll do just fine. This nailer however, did not meet my expectations. Didn't matter if I was using 2 inch nails or 2 1/2....didn't matter if I was nailing into a low profile interior trim, or thicker 5/4 material...didn't matter if I had the depth as deep as it would go and the compression gauge all the way to max...didn't matter how I held the gun against the material...it just wouldn't countersink the nails consistently. Maybe 6/10 successful countersinking. That meant more time manually punching nails and filling holes. Another issue I was having was the constant ""skipping"" off the nail head causing basically 2 holes to puddy AND the nail head was not countersunk. That didn't happen too often, but it was enough to make me say aloud, ""what the???"" The price listed above is insane- I picked up mine at the Home Depot for $200. It's possible I just had a defective product, because all the other reviews I've read were glowing for this exact same product. It's possible it was defective, but it's possible the next one will be too- so I'm going to purchase the newer Senco F16. Same conveniences, still less than Dewalt, and looks like a space-gun.
I gave it 2 stars because I still love Ryobi, and other than this experience- their other tools have stood up to my wrath."

Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"Not for bigger dogs, destroyed in one hour, the bunny toy lasted a week or so."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,Used by one 12 week old kitten. NOT STURDY AT ALL. Disappointed!!!!  Would not recommend!!!
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,I'm sure they are great my dogs didn't care for them and they usually love everything
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"Not that easy to put on.  If your doggy has a big neck, forget it."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,The fake black leather really stinks not safe for your pet do not buy.
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,3.5 Stars. Worked ok (better than Polysporin) for my German Shepherd's eye infections due to his allergies.
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,THIS VALVE CONSIDER QUALITY NOT WHAT I EXPECTED THE SCREW TO  ADJUST EASY TO GET STRIP.
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,The ramp is too skinny and steep. The dogs won't use it.  Was a waste of money.
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,beware...very very small!! very small!! easily could be swallowed by a puppy !! let alone by a dog!!
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,Nice product not worth $50 but I sent it back my dog wants nothing to do with it
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"After making some necessary alterations, the harness worked great.  Strap coming up between hind legs NOT NECESSARY."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"Like the idea of putting treat inside the toy, but for bigger dogs (Rott) she chewed right threw it."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,it can be dangerous if the dog runs it can snap. use caution when using this kind of leash.
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"So close, but not strong enough. As another reviewer said, large, determined dogs will push through this with ease."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"Dogs didn't like it.  Very thin, have to use about 3 at one time to get any traction."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"Just buy packing tape. Its cheaper, sticks better, and is not sticky on both sides like this tape is."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"Thought I was getting the shredded stuff. My fault; should have read closer. Tried it, but hate the pellets"
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"Turns into saw dust when wet, then becomes impossible to scoop. You have to just dump out all out."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,My bad I guess I did not read the description.  Too much money for the very small lampchops.
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"It did not work for the 2 cats I bought it for, didn't seems to effect them at all."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,quality is great but keeping the top carpet with ripples is impossible. after about 10 minutes it flops flat.
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,Love the snails but am fighting a losing battle with baby snails. Never had this problem before with snails.
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,Lasted 15 minutes with my 2 year old Wheaton Terrier. He got the squeakers out and finished off the rest.
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,The bows are cute but clip doesn't stay in place. I had to take off clip and put rubber bands.
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"Super cute except, my black lab and yellow lab destroyed this the day we got it. So not very durable."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,An absolute waste of my time and money. It did nothing to prevent my cat from peeing on the doors...
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,My dog likes this nylabone but the points on it are very sharp now that it is a little chewed.
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"Was hoping it was more scented so my blind dog would be able to locate it, however, did not happen."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,These pads are ok but a bit smaller than most and less absorbant so you have to change them often
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"I have 3 cats, one of which will eat ANYTHING.  All 3 of them snubbed their noses at this."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,This didn't work for me at all. It worked for a friend though so... maybe I'm just an idiot :-(
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,its ok but I found some I like much bettergets dikrty way too fast and the sizes are not true
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,Returned because the size medium was much bigger than others I've ordered.  My dog slipped right out of it.
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,Was good for 2 months before the leather snapped. Customer service was really great and attentive to the issue when mentioned.
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"Buyer beware. this is farmed, not wild salmon. So bummed I spent $50 on this to treat a dog with cancer."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,It was too high in fat. I had to get rid of it. Made my kitty sick.
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"My dog, who LOVES veggies, would not even give these a second sniff!  They look and feel just like cardboard."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,My dog is so not interested in this bone. It has little texture and it's just a hard piece of rubber/plastic.
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,The product is great but the package was broken when it arrived. I had to put all the wipes in a bag
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,I found a piece of plastic in one of the treats I have a picture if you would like to see it
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,it is okay but i recommend the temperature gun instead though. its more accurate and accuracy is key with a reptile habitat.
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,It's fine but I haven't seen tons of difference in my pup. She doesn't seem to mind it on her food either
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,MY DOGS TORE IT APART IN AN AFTERNOON...NOT THE QUALITY IVE COME TO KNOW & EXPECT FROM KONG !!! WASTE OF MONEY
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"Too fat and awkward to use, but they have a similar version at Wal-Mart which is thinner and I like much better."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,It's OK not as loud as I would like.  It's loud enough for the house but not over about 70 feet
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"Uncomfortable for my dog, he chewed it off while he was in his crate and he has never done anything like that before!"
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,It said large on the web site and yet it wouldn't even fit over my 10 week old puppy's head.  misleading information.
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"This is yet another Gooby harness that I bought after carefully measuring my dog and consulting the size chart, that just doesn't fit."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"It keeps our 3 month old GSD pup in a safe place, but he was able to bend the wires with his teeth."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"My puppy chewed this toy up within 10 minutes.  Not sturdy, but the process of getting a return was fast and efficient."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"My cat is very finicky so I thought I would try these snacks.  They are probably good, but she refuses to eat them."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"I am not the one that should review this. If my cat could talk he would say, it's food any yogurt in the house?"
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,I really didn't like these to much. They are small but the rounded tips are a little to big for trimming around the eyes.
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,This makes a fun noise and our pup was so excited to play with it! Unfortunately he chewed it up in less than an hour!
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,This heater does NOT have a thermal cutoff and will quickly overheat your water when it fails. I had 2 fail at the same time.
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,think pump i would not recommend...it broke with in a week ..hard to set up....falls apart...waste of money machineland dropped the ball on this one
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,My dog did not seem to care for the taste and even when he did eat them they did not seem to do much for him.
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"The product stickers didn't fully come off the bowls, so now it's forever stuck on there. I ended up buying new bowls that are dishwasher safe."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"My dog took zero interest in this nylabone. I think it's just too hard for her. She likes the softer ones that have a ""chicken"" flavor."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"These are like treat size for a large dog. My dog doesn't even lay down with the, she just chomps them in a couple bites."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"I wasn't impressed with this. My dog figured out how to fully open the little food door very quickly, so it didn't keep her occupied long."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,This cage is very flimsy.  Cheap material.  Door latch barely works. Roof not secured.  Spend a little more for a better quality cage!
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"My puppy destroyed this thing in one day, the squecker was torn from its body well before the frog was decapitated. do not buy for dogs."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"Eldest cat laid atop it for a day or two, but neither cat show any interest in it. They liked the box it came in though."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,I bought these for my two house dogs.  They are picky and don't particularly care for them but our boxer in the yard likes them.
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,Worst material. My dog chewed into it in ten minutes and he is a regular golden. I would advise not to buy this. Waste of money.
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"Unfortunately my dog didn't like these much. He ate one, which didn't have any apparent effect, and then wasn't interested. I couldn't blame him- they smelled medicinal."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,Returned it. Was way to small for my dog who only weighs 9 pounds. Had no body at all even with the straps to hold it up.
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,Do not order more than one box as Amazon does not take back even unopened cat food ...something to remember in case your cat does not like
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,I tried on our dog who is allergic to fleas and didn't work like said. arrived on time when said was pleased with sender just not product
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,Can't say if it works or not because my cat refused to open her mouth and I got a good scratching when I tried to make her.
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,It works as intended but smaller litter chunks tend to slip out from the holes of this scoop. It'd be perfect if this scoop had smaller holes.
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"I have been using frontline for years, but lately doesn't seem to be working for my dogs. After applying, there are still signs of fleas and constant itching."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,Bought this for our Big puppy!  She does not like it - too hard to chew on and she is a 'chewer' and has a large mouth.
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"My cat hates this thing, cheaply constructed Velcro edges are sharp on corners,
and cat played with for 30 seconds the hid it from me never to find again.
Garbage."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"I don't like this stuff. It's not very easy to use and mold caves from it. Honestly, it's not worth the hassle. I won't be buying this again."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"Too thin to hold much.  I ended up buying ""poise"" pads and cut them each in half to put in our doggie diapers for our senior dog."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"Dried meat is safe but I am questioning why they are not sanitized first and if the urine is allowed to stay in/on them, wouldn't the harbor bacteria?"
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"Med fira my 10 pound dog in every brand but this one. In this one its small and forces her legs to the front, will never buy again."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"The X-L does not even fit over my dogs head - the sizing is extremely small and had to return.
On the positive side, the fabric and quality was beautiful."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,Not a good range of smaller comb sizes and I think the sizes marked on them run a little longer or taller however you want to look at it.
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"Flimsy, thin, cheap looking and feeling, bad chemical laden smell prior to washing before I would put it anywhere near my dog. I am discarding it. Waste of money."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"This is not the ""bendable"" soft bone like the other one this company sells. My dog goes nuts for the bendable one thats minty. This one, she won't touch."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,I bought this because my old clippers were not cutting the nail cleanly. It kind of left the nail ragged. This one is the same as my old pair.
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,My dog hates it... it's too big to fit into the back of his mouth to get to his rear molars. He takes off running every time he sees it.
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"Did not work, ultimately found its way to the garage. Pieces seem to be made cheaply and did not fit on any of my filters."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"Probably best for smaller dogs. The mesh and straps are very lightweight and seem comfortable, but my dog is 70 lbs and this harness didn't keep him from pulling much!"
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"These are NOT the pearls. These are the hard sharp chunks that neither my maine coon kitty or I enjoy stepping on. I love the actual pearls, but this sucks."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"Average boots.  Not  good for frequent use.
Bottom  has holes after approximately three uses.
 It would be better to spend more money and get a higher quality boot."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,I thought for sure this would be a good winner for the dogs but they turned their nose to these flavor combination.  I donated it to the local pound.
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"i got the exo terra one, its awesome, spend a lil more and do it right. your reptile will love your for it. there you go, i hope this helps."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"Got the white bone tag. The metal is soft, its been several months now and the edges are scratched . Also, the text is white so hard to see whats written."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"Used product for several weeks and saw no difference in nitrates going down, they did however go up and I switched to purigen and now my nitrates are going back down"
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,The stitching is horrible!!!!!!!! The one picture I have here shows a small string pointing up. That was the only thing holding it together spend extra money and get something better
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"Wow,

  This is not clumping litter so forget the poop and scoop process. It is basically non clumping liter. I like Arm and Hammer but this is a horrible product."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,I was disappointed in this.  Maybe it's just my cats but they could of cared less when I sprayed it on things.  I will try something else next time.
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,My cat will play for about 30 seconds and leaves it behind. I have to give it to a friend. She has a younger cat. Hopefully her cat likes this toy.
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"Made my dog sick. Vomited after the 2 times he had them the expiration date was not legible , only half printed. I threw them away before realizing I should've returned them."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,These are really not the items I was expecting.  They have bells in the them which I was not aware of and I worry about my dogs accidentally consuming the bell.
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"I heard this was great to keep doggies' teeth tarter free, but my dogs hate it. They act like it's the worse thing I've ever put in their mouths."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"I can't believe these are veterinary approved.  Just smell one and that should tip you off....smells like chemicals.  Evidently my dogs think so too, because they will not eat them."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"Too big for my 18lb dog. I thought that she might be able to bite onto the furry thingies, but there's not much to hold onto. Only recommend it for large breeds."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"did not do much, would cost a furtune to use for every day, i had yard sprayed for fleas and ticks, works great, yes i cheat i am a pest control guy."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,Dogs ate a couple times and then starting turning nose up to it. Smells bad. I have to use peanut butter to get them to eat it. Will not buy it again.
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,My cats really didn't go for this. So it sits in the room unused. Great idea I would guess for younger cats but my older cats don't want to bother with it.
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"This company keeps changing their door size standards so every time you buy a replacement, it
doesn't fit.

we're going to just buy a whole new back door and start over.
highly UNRECOMMENDED!

Purchase with caution."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,The mat is soft and nice. It is not plush as it suggests in in the description. This might work better for smaller dogs but my 78 pound labradoodle needs more cushion.
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,I was really excited to get this air prey toy for my cats. However after 20mins it broke in 2 different spots ): I don't think I would buy this product again.
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"My kitty doesn't care at all for the bug, and the wire is much too stiff, so we put bird feathers on it and he will play with it from time to time."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"Horrible ""absorbency""  In no way does this product compare to the disposable wraps they sell at Petsmart. It's a shame I can't buy a better quality, better absorbency wrap on Amazon :("
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,My puppy did not care for these much but my older dog ate it in one seating. Approx 10 minutes to devour for the 13 year old Sheltie. I would not purchase again.
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,This dress is very cute but made a bit smaller than other Fitwarm brand size mediums. Also material is too soft which allows the sides to bunch together and hang on the floor.
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"I want to buy this brand...but my dogs hate the lifesource bits.  They love the rest, but it is a mess picking up the lifesource bits they spit out on the floor."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"buy a size slightly larger...
Chilly Dog Cable Dog Sweater,  which I have reviewed and is without any constraints in
covering the dog quickly and better by far!  you get what you pay for."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,Don't bother buying this.  I purchased it to locate exactly the places my cat had sprayed so I could treat the correct places and this light did nothing!  Don't bother buying it.
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,I just received my package and when I unscrewed the lid the seal was ripped and there was no scoop. My kitty has IBD and was really wanting to get her started on this.
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,Have been a professional dog groomer for over 10 years... I decided to try this product. I must say I don't think it helps at all. It doesn't make anything worse... But it doesn't help.
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"This is advertised good and safe for rats. However, 47 of my 50 rats had serious eye problems. Itchy, redness, inflammation, and even red tears. I would never buy this product for my rats again."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,Powerful enough for a small aquarium or for extra circulation but it doesn't pivot & have a lot of flexibility to change where it flows as it'll just pop out of its suction mount easily.
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"Good product overall, fair price. The ball has a strange smell  to it that has not gone away even after several months . It is somewhat hard to get it really clean as well."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"got this thought it was the dog pill pockets when it got here and it for cats we thought ok , then we opened them and they were dry and the dogs did not dig'em"
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"From reading previous reviews, I knew the size would be a bit smaller. It is a thin blanket that attracts a ton of hair. Soft but my dog prefers regular throw blankets that are thicker."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,this has kept my golden retriever very busy but it is not for a Rottweiler. it was torn apart in minutes by one. had to return and got one day shipping from amazon. great service.
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,Product was made well however the bag hung too long and my 8 lb yorkie would tumble out because the sides were not sturdy enough to keep him in or to give hi.
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,This product is not safe for dogs.  It gives off sharp shards and is hard as a rock.  My dogs back teeth are ruined.  Not worth the risk ... find another safer chew.
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"I based my size choice on feedback I'd seen about this product, but it's too small. I'd love to be able to send it back for an exchange, but it may be cost prohibitive to do so."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,I have one indoor cat and this did nothing to reduce the flea problem! Finally with a comonation of Siphotrol Plus Fogger 6oz and 20 mule team borax sprinled on the rugs I got those little blood suckers!
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"Hardly any filling, my 6lb puppy was essentially sleeping on the ground.. Cheap felt feeling cover. Didn't wash well, and my puppy managed to tear a hole in it and shred it in a month. Would not recommend."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"My dogs love these chews, but they are gone within five minutes. There are many other chews that offer more bang for the buck. Though I may revisit these in the future since my girls do love 'em."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"I love the material & the design; however, the belt clip doesn't hold firmly enough.  Bend over & it pops off easily.  I really wanted to love this.  Sadly, it will probably sit on the shelf."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,Thought since it was made of tough stuff that it would last awhile.  I hope the body lasts because the feet were chewed off within 5 minutes.  We have a black lab that is not a chewer.
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"I actually had one dose without any medication in it. I m sure it was a manufacturing snafu but none the less.... Also, it works but doesn t seem to last for 30 days...more like 2.5 to 3 weeks."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"I purchased this because i misplaced my higher end grooming set when we moved.
It works as expected but it's also incredibly loud, vibrates much more than our old said and our dog is terrified.
It will do the job though."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"This product claims to be a large bowl but I can't even fit my fist into it, my bulldog could use this as a muzzle.  It's picturesd with a Lab dog my dog is smaller than most Lab dogs."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,Didnt last long as advertised. I usually get another brand and my puppy never gets flees. Decided to try this one due to the tick prevention. With this one on the 2nd week she got flees. Not worth the money.
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"we originally bought for food and water BUT the water kept seeping passed the hole at the edge for lift the chrome bowl out to clean or refill...though the quality seemed to be there, we will be donating these items."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"Sorry to see this product was made in China. After the discovery of the bad dog food from China in addition to other things (lead paint in children's toys), I don't feel completely confident that these treats are not harmful."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"I like the look of this leash and it's comfortable in my hand when I'm walking my dog, but the hook hardware is big and heavy for a small dog so I would not recommend this for dogs less than 20lbs."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"Tried this shampoo several times on my dog hoping it would work after some time and it didn't help with anything. Didn't work for itching or hot spots, not even for a day. Unfortunately, it doesn't live up to its claim."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"My 3 months old kitty really love this toy but it broke the next day. The ""joint"" of the suspender is too weak to withstand the pull. I just cut off the string and let my kitty have the mouse instead."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"I bought this to trick out yorkie and yorkie-poo into better smiles.  While the spray smells nice and minty - the size of the ball is too big for my 5 and 12 pound dogs.  So for me, it's okay."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"This is easy to put together and nice looking, for a cat drinking fountain.  But the motor is noisy--could hear it over the TV in the next room--and our cats were not interested in it at all.  Sent it back."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"The pieces were so small my min-pin swallowed them whole...That is why I gave them  a 3. I gave them to a friend who has a tea cup poodle, and she really likes them so they also need a 5 from her.."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"This works a little better than most clumping litters, but it still tracks and doesn't do as good a job as Cedarific to fight odor. It is very expensive to pay $18 to barely fill two litter boxes; won't purchase in the future."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"Packed Well by Amazon and arrived undamaged.  However, all 6 of my cats didn't like it.  They picked at it and left if for the dogs to clean up!  First Friskies Flavor I've found that NONE of my cats liked!"
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"...but look at each others dish first to see what the other guy got! LOL. Why the red dye, 9Lives? AND I haven't had to use a can opener to open a can in a long time. I will not buy this again."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,The carabiner is kind of a pain to use.  I like it because it fits well in a pocket when I am not using it.  To be honest it is not much better than a cheap leash that costs 5 bucks.
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"My mini dachshunds managed to rip the head open within half an hour, along with chew the ears off and start on the legs. Thankfully it was cheap, so I'm not annoyed. It does say on the packet it isn't for strong chewers."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"I bought it and use it but I don't see much birds like it much  some time three or four days still outside ,, no idea why ,, but its conv delivered home  & I may be change other next time ,,"
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"Did not work at all...my dogs ran right through it with out even a second of hesitation. Unfortunately I waited too long to try it out, so it is past the return policy! DO NOT BUY for large dogs...it might work for a cat!"
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,Our vet told us that ticks gave become resistant to frontline and it does not work as well as it used to. It has treated us well for years but after finding several ticks on our dog this year we switched to a newer product.
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"Cats had no interest in this toy. I didn't want to give it a one star because the quality is great, and it's just too cute. But, I don't want to rate it high either because my cats are usually interested in everything and anything!"
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"All of my three cats prefer other toys with feathers.  With this one they just sit there wondering what the heck it is.  It's very small and actually looks more like a hairball than a mouse, or whatever it's supposed to look like."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"this product is okay I guess. My dog really have a bad breath, saw online the reviews pretty good try it for a month only, well I can say is his breath improves just a little it's because I can still smell his bad breath."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"Idk... maybe its just my cats..
But this toys a waste of money my cats aren't exactly smart enough to figure this out.. or plot twist are too smart for this the flip it over to get the treats they don't care for it entertainment wise."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"We have 4 cats. They have all been spayed and/or neutered. One male still sprayed somewhat. We tried the Feliway spray. I'm still trying it out to see is it has any effect, however the plug in units are wonderful and work exceptionally well.  ."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"Beware!! I purchased this a year ago and just bought a second one. It's supposed to be the exact same item, but the new one is very flimsy and much smaller. I'm going to try to return it. I doubt this new version will hold up."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"It's a good product for the money, but way too big for my bird. It's not the products fault that I couldn't imagine how big 8 inches was. But it would be great for a large bird like an Eclectus, African Gray, or even a Macaw."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,This is a terrible product. It doesn't sit up on its own. I'm so mad at myself for even buying this but all the previous reviews made it look so great. Total waste of money. My 10 lb min pin can barely hide out in it!!
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,Would love this product if it came with a roof. My dog very quickly learned that she could climb it - and climb it she did. Wouldn't hold her for more than 5 minutes (but still a lot sturdier than the canvas pen that I purchased)
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"I was hoping my two male cats would like it.  One of them will eat one or two pieces, the other just walks away from it.  Going to have to donate the whole box to the Animal Shelter.  Maybe they will have better luck."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"I've been using this indoor- hung on my door nob to stop the barking.  The machine works fine, but does not seem to bother my dachshund- keeps barking through anything... meanwhile my pitbull seems more affected by it and will cower & go back to bed."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"Although I am not completely convinced these work, we are on our third bottle. We have noticed that the dead spots are decreasing but we still have them occuring. We just moved to a new home so I look forward to seeing if there is any difference."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,None of my 3 cats likes these Lysine supplement chews. They are definitely NOT soft and need to be broken up into smaller pieces. I threw the product away and will stick with the Lysine gel and an empty syringe (just ask your pharmacist for one...they're usually free).
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,My Chocolate Lab. went through this guy a little too fast. I'd go up on the Tuffy scale to a higher number (less easy to destroy) but the 9's are all such boring shapes. I guess that's why they last so long? It's boring to the dog too?
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"Bowl fell apart on second use. Top ring came completely off. Then second and third rings began to separate. We were traveling and needed the bowl for water and food, very disappointed!!
We have had other collapsible products before ( a funnel etc) that never did this."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,Wasn't well constructed so my dog was able to eat it in one day. It did fit perfectly inside his crate but I am very disappointed that it didn't hold up to any chewing. He has toys that have lasted over 4 months so this just wasn't very durable.
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"Well, the dogs seem to like them, although once they start chewing on them, there are sharp edges that have cut my pup's mouth.  The odor is awful, but maybe the dogs like that.  The price is too high for the amount of time that they last."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"The thing about these is that the hood doesn't leave much room for the dog's neck to move around. It's similar to the idea of actual hoodies for people... some hoodies are loose fitting and comfortable. Others are a bit restraining, such as these. But they are very cute."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"I guess you really do get what you pay for!  These pads were inexpensive compared to some others and I won't buy them again because they are ""too"" thin and the pet urine leaks right through.  I use them with my sturdier pads most of the time."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,Seems bright on max and at that level should work well for plants.  But the 24/7 option is ridiculous.  You'll have light on your tank for like 16 hours at some level or another and half the time the light is dim.  Cant beat the price though.
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"I bought this collar for dog walks after dark during the winter months. I have a white dog and would have to say that the dog is more reflective than the collar unfortunately. It seems durable, however I don't feel the dog is much more visible when we use it."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"This is a nice plant. It has a good solid base that keeps it well-anchored in the gravel, and it looks quite real. However,  I  think it would have been cheaper to buy it in the store than purchasing it online, since they do occasionally go on sale."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"Even though I measured my dog before purchasing this harness and bought the recommended size, I cannot get the front straps (where the least clips in) to be small enough to fit his body. He can fully get out of it and this is incredibly dangerous. I want a full refund!"
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"My dog (100lb mastiff, injured cruciate) couldn't walk well in the brace. She swayed and almost fell. The brace was a tid bit too long but the strap over the hips was good idea to keep it from slipping. Going to exchange for a different size, I hope it works better."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,This product definitely removes a lot of hair but after researching I found that it actually cuts the hair rather than pulling out the undercoat. I noticed that my cat's fur next to the skin has a prickly feel where the hair has been cut. I don't use it any more.
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,Definitely not my favorite. I don't think I'll get this for my dog again after she's finished with this bag. These meatballs are very soft and get stuck in her teeth. It caused her some discomfort for several minutes after eating it. I think we are best with sticking with crunchy snacks.
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"This is the second time it broke in the same area, the part where you push to close door and lock it.  They gave me a new one.  I have only had this a year with light use and it broke again.  Super annoyed, do not waste your money."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"I purchased this thinking it would help my puppy stop pulling on the leash, but the harness rubs under his legs and he is distracted by the leash hanging in front of him. The set looks nice and is well constructed. I'll use the leash, but have no use for the harness."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,The dog clothes are all the wrong sizes like 1 small is for a teacup and another small is a small so u have to order a large for a small or a extra large for a small it gets very confusing and they don't honor exchanges I've got burned 6 times
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"This gate is easy to install and looks good at first, however my very large 70 pound pitbull was able to get through the small pet door and harass my poor cat upstairs this gate ended up not serving its purpose of giving my cat a safe space away from the dog."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"Lightweight means the cats track it everywhere.  I have found litter all over the house.  The regular Clump & Seal litter is fantastic.  I will stick with it.
It does clump well, and odors aren't bad. If it wasn't for excessive tracking, I'd rate it higher and maybe keep using it."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,Really like it but mine started getting really loud after not even a month. I oil the blade and clean it properly but sometimes the switch to change sizes sticks and also the 10 will randomly start catching hair. Which really sucks because I use that more than any of the other lengths..
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"Nice idea but flimsy in construction.  Given that you're trying to control your dog, the dog pulls or tries to get it off by pawing his face, the strap and plastic construction are way too flimsy.  I would rather pay more and have a quality product.  Nice concept, low quality."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,The concept was nice but was very disappointed with the quality of the materials used. It is a fleece like material but is basically threadbare. The cats are basically laying on particle board. Had they used just a little thicker/softer material I would have given this 5 stars. I would not purchase again.
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"I fed a tiny bit of this to 2 nothobranchius guentheri fry (baby killifish). They had been doing fine on freshly hatched fairy shrimp for 3 days, so I figured it was time to move them up to a slightly larger food. Within 1 hour of feeding this stuff both fish were dead."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"sometimes they work, sometimes they don't.  They say it's according to how many fleas are around to hop aboard and keep pestering until that they bite the dust.  I guess it's better than not using anything but frustrating to have your pet still scratching and licking (just maybe not as much?)..."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,I've been using this product daily and it doesn't seem to be working.  I've previously bought Angel Eyes in powder form that worked within a week.  Completely got rid of my white fur dogs brown eye drippage.  That was no longer available which is the reason I bought this product.
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,I have a 2004 Toyota 4Runner and could not figure out how to fit this after several tries. I even had a friend try to see if they could fit it and it just would not work with the bungee cords that came with the barrier. It may just be my car though :/
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"Bought for fabric furniture-paid a little more expecting better product than two sided tape. Two sided tape is just as good, if not better. Product does not easily stick to any surface, really. The roll is also inconvenient to use and makes cutting off pieces difficult. Wasted many pieces when cutting off with scissors."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"When you have a strong chewing dog, you can't expect a toy like this to last very long.  Like maybe 3 minutes max.  So it went for this toy.  I do better tying shreds of old clothing to the Teaser.  Forget squeakers for my dog--she will disable them within minutes."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"These are really flimsy and tear easily. I will keep buying them though, because they are the only ones I can find that fit the Littermaid box. I do use them with a bag, which makes them more cost effective because you can use them more than once. Overall, they're fine for what they are."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,One pouch of this was just enough to add to our dogs meal for one day. They liked it but one day is not enough to gauge the probiotic effects of the product. I have to say that the packaging is ridiculous and I had to struggle mightily to wrestle the cap off the pouch.
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"This was a replacement for another, much softer frisbee that my dog loved but is no longer made.  Unfortunately this one is not nearly as soft but it's the best I have found. One has to be careful as teeth marks in it can be sharp due to its less than pliable and tougher construction."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"Unfortunately, my 5 cats only found them fun for about 5 minutes.  I now put them in a bag with some Kong catnip and bring new ones out about once a week for something different.  They have lasted a good while, but they don't play with them much once the catnip smell is gone."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,My yellow lab ate this in 3 days.  Every evening I would find the two pieces separated in different parts of the yard. The plastic was pretty soft and a larger dog could easily chew it to pieces.  It didn't serve its purpose. My dog thought of it as a toy not a waterer...
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,This spray is very aromatic when first sprayed but the smell dissipates quickly. We have 6 kitties and ended up rescuing a stray Tom about a month ago but we're having a difficult time integrating him into the family. I feel like this spray works for calming some of the cats but definitely not all of them.
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,The great charcoal for a typical aquarium and value priced. However don't use it on low pH aquariums like Tetra's or Discus as if you have the pH adjusted down this will raise it. I soaked it for a week and rinse before and after the soak to help prevent the pH change but it happened anyway.
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"It's very frustrating to try and fit it on the faucet head. It doesn't fit mine perfectly, so it slips off about half a dozen times during each tank cleaning and I have to reattach it. It's a serious hassle.

That being said, it's waaaaay easier to clean my 20 gallon tank WITH this thing than WITHOUT it!"
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"I would never order these again. If I could take a photo and show you how yellow these are I would. I hate to see what is coming into my healthy cats water right now. Go to the other buyer I bought them from, look at my history, his were perfect. He has my business from now on."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,I like the color and that it has 2 doors but the latches are a hassle. You have to make sure they are moved out of the way before you try to close the  door and it's takes twice as long since there are 2 latches on each door. The paint is already chipping around the latches.
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"It whistles, but didn't get any of my three dogs' attention. I believe they were laughing at me. I wanted something to help stop barking out the window, or when someone came to my door. This was a failure with a Wire Haired Pointing Griffon and two Rottweilers. I purchased the Pet Corrected from Amazon, and that works awesome."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,I was extremely disappointed in this product. I purchased it for my rabbit. I was expecting it to be the size of a small coke can. It's the size of a large pencil. Definitely not worth the money. I hope Kaytee is able to recommend this to mice and hamsters as it's even too small for a guinea pig.
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"..... but my kitties won't eat much of it.

I like to give my fur babies the best food I can afford, so I tried this.  Turns out that to get them to eat it I have to mix it with the cheap gravy-laden stuff or they sample it and then leave the bulk of it on the plate.

Sigh."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,The gentle leader works great for walking my dog. She can't pull me and I don't have to worry about her slipping out of it. Unfortunately mine broke after just a couple of months. The plastic clamp that holds the loop under the dog's chin is a little flimsy apparently. I'm going to contact the company for a replacement.
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"Just opened this package.  They are supposed to be a soft treat, but are not.  These are cute little flower like treats that are hard as a rock.  Just junk for small dog training.  Won't buy again.. Sell by date is later this year but no idea why these should be hard.  Save your money."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,This was a fun toy with a very durable outer shell.  My dog and I still use it to play tug of war and fetch occasionally.  The main reason he liked the toy when it first came was the crunchy ball in the middle.  This ball quickly broke though and became just a flat piece of plastic.
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,Wood chips/curls are sharp and poke through the covering.  Had to pick them out only to find more kept working their way to the surface.  Dog wasn't able to use in this condition.  Made in China.... Stuffing was brittle and course.  Ended up emptying out stuffing and filling with store purchased fiber-fill.  Very expensive project.
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"I hate it because it arrived broken, and to get a replacement or refund I have to return it.  It was $17 - not worth my time to take it to UPS or the post office so I'm tossing it.  Bad quality control.  I have no idea if it would work and I probably won't find out."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"Muzzle is made of nylon and completely washable. Adjustable with minimal buckles. Description says that it will help prevent biting, barking, and chewing while allowing panting and drinking. My dachshund figured out how to bark with it on. So, if you're wanting it for the non barking feature, I wouldnt count on it. However, it would combat biting and chewing."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"I don't have a problem with the product itself but it is packaged in a flimsy, unsealed, cardboard box and the small carbon flecks leak out of the packaging.  This ruined some of the other items that were shipped with it in an earlier order, so now I am very careful what other items I purchase at the same time."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"Based on reviews I was really hoping these would cut the dogs nails like butter, but found them no more effective or easier to use than the cheaper versions I bought at a local box store.  They do the job but not quickly and easily as I'd hoped.  Disappointed.  Maybe the tool I am dreaming of doesn't exist?"
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"Too flimsy for a large iguana. It was like waling a St. Bernard with dental floss! He easily slipped out of it and I almost lost him; not to mention the tail smacks that I got, leaving red marks on arms and legs. Would NOT recommend this product for iguanas over 2 feet and/or iguanas that are aggressive and not socialized."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,Was rather hard to put together physically. I had to break out a hammer to get the tubs to fit properly in the holes. Also which ever car that sleeps on top has to sleep on a strip of rough Velcro. The other downside is that to clean it... I have to take it back apart and hammer it back together.
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"I put these collars on my 2 cats that were looking sideways at each other.  After putting them on each cat, I had hoped they would calm themselves down.  It seemed to me that they got worse after I put the collars on them.  Didn't make sense to me so, I don't think they really did the trick."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"My dog does not mind me using this on her so that is good but the brush removes only a small amount of hair (easy to remove the hair from the brush) compared to a silicone brush which seems to pull out more hair but the hair is on the floor and on the brush.

I am not alternating between both brushes."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"September 30, 2017
Seller change your description of item this particular item is made for little-dogs not big ones. i just got mine today and my shorty-bull 44lbs broke it by one tug-pulled not even the lock held her strength. Therefore picture is much more deceiving and not what to expect when it arrives,  too small, narrow cording, cheaply made."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,My dog loves to chase things so a ball is a great toy for her. She is at the intense chewing phase so she likes that she can grab and chew this toy. She is around 3lbsz Kinda a flimsy so am not sure how much it will last when she grows up a little more. Do not recomend for bigger breads.
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"Great if you use it as a hat! Otherwise, who can see it when your dog's looking down or it's otherwise obscured? I found this use makes the most sense: Unexpected so it gets the attention I want, which is for SMALL dogs to stay away (NOT all dogs)! Don't worry folks: When the walk starts his scowl turned into a huge smile!"
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"The material quality is fine, but they are the thinnest beds I have ever purchased.  Luckily we purchased two for the travel crate.  The beds we get a Costco are much superior quality at a much less expense.  We were specifically attempting to fit a crate for travel NEXT week, otherwise I would have sent them back.  Very disappointed.........."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"This mat has almost no padding in the bottom, but our dog doesn't seem to mind too much. The bigger issue is that it dries incredibly slowly. Our dog has thrown up on it in the car a couple of times and it's a real pain to clean, then takes a long time to dry, so we essentially need another mat as backup."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"These treats were rock-hard, they have a slightly strange smell, and my dog wouldn't touch them. The regular is HUGE. One half of one was kind of big for my 19 lb dog. I can't say how digestible they are because he wouldn't eat them. 2 stars because they seem like a fairly good deal for the money-- if your dog will eat them."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"I stumbled on this from a decent bit of googling ""best cat food"", thinking what my cats currently have was probably slop. Though Earthborn is probably the best, scientifically, the fish smell is so pungent that my cats won't even step near it, even while mixed. I'm sure SOME cat will love this, though, so it's going to my local Back Street Cat Rescue."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"This is an awesome toy, except that my pup has torn a piece off on the first day. She loves puzzles and this looked perfect since she recently been chewing things that are similar texture that aren't toys. Kyjen toys are the favorite for my dogs, but this particular one I can only recommend if your dog doesn't destructively chew bc it isn't very strong"
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,Buyer beware! This is not safe for KITTENS! My two month old kitten got her head stuck between the arch and the post. I manually pulled the post away to free her. She gagged three times immediately afterwards but seems fine now. If I hadn't have been there she could have perished! The space between the arch and post is too big for a baby kitty.
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"These hairball treats haven't been our cats favorite.  I break each treat in half & mix with a few Temptations treats. They will eat the Temptations treats and avoid the hairball treats. If I leave the hairball treats out for the cats, the treats get hard and I have to throw away. I'll continue to look for something that works and that our cats will eat."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,Upside is the great hot pink color.  I currently use 1 cup bowls and these are a tad smaller (about a half an inch) in circumference compared to my other 1 cup bowls.  There is no way you can fit a cup in here.  Pretty deceptive.  When in doubt size up.  I imagine the 2 cup is not quite 2 cups etc.
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"This might work for a small dog who stays inside but I needed this to keep the white coat clean of a great pyrenees.  It's very thin and did not fit the three tags.  If he runs through branches, this would have torn off the pouch.  I guess I will use clear nail polish on the tags to keep them from discoloring the fur."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"Poorly designed handles. With them being in the middle, while holding the handles, whenever my pet would go to either side, the whole carrier would tip in that direction, making it hard to balance. Also, there are two hard, plastic ridges on the inside of the carrier that stick straight up that could poke or injure my pet if he were to step or fall on them."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"This cute toy has 3 squirrels in a tree stump, all filled toys, of course. My miniature Schnauzer enjoyed ""hunting"" the squirrels, but quickly figured out how to get them out of the various holes. He then proceeded to rip each one's tail off, then rip apart each squirrel, ""de-stuff"" them, and leave stuffing all over the floor. It's a cute toy, but no good for aggressive chewers!"
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,this is NOT a good habitat for hermit crabs. they need at least 6 inches or more of sand/echo earth substrate to bury in so they can molt and this would only hold one crab and crabs need friends to stay alive. this is not a good thing to buy unless you want to let your crabs slowly die because they can't molt or they haven't got the right humidity/heat.
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,All I got out of this lousy product were huge bubbles out of three locations on this piece of junk.  Whatever happened to a mist of bubbles like I wanted.  I bought a much cheaper airstone that really delivered the goods.  I'm just going to keep this bubble disk as an emergency ornament (if that means anything).  I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone.
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"Well received trimming which I was skeptical about in the first place put them in my planted tank attached them to a log, and some in the substrate and after about a week they have started to rot. I have no Problem with any other plants in my tank. These were just cutting no roots or anything. I have co2. Just not a good plant, well bowl of trimmings."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"I ordered this dog food because my dog didn't seem to like his other dog food and it looked very healthy. My dog liked the food, but I noticed he was losing weight. I have a Sheltie that thinks he is a Greyhound, and weight has never been an issue for him. I suppose if your pet needs to shed a few pounds this may be the food for him."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"I would give zero stars if I could. I put the collar on my cat leaving a finger width as suggested. 4 days later he looked as if he was having a seizure! Somehow the collar stretched out and became lodged in his mouth, and he was choking. I had to restrain him and cut the collar off. If I wasn't at home he would have died. Not worth it."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"I don't have to say too much as these are made in China. I was shocked when Dogswell products are switched from made in USA to made in China without letting us consumers know. I think it's very sneaky to increase their profit that way, but still charge us consumers the same price they used to charge when they are actually made in USA. I am VERY disappointed in Dogswell."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"I cant imagin shipping a product that was obviously missing a part. Seriously, either this was created by a machine and boxed by a machine, or the person who packed it doesnt give a darn. I will change the number of stars if someone can ship the missing piece. Temporarily, I put a piece of foam to keep my cats from getting hurt with the exposed sharp staples inside the arm."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"It is a big relief not having to carry water to my 55 gal. tank every time I need to clean it. However, I  gave it 3 stars because the suction is not very good. It picks up the small stuff, but for the larger stuff I have to use our hand held battery operated filter. Also, you have to run the faucet the whole time you are using it."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"my 9 mo old cavapoo adores this toy. but his way of showing affection is to tear the trunk apart and chew the squirrels to death. No matter how many times I show him the proper way to play this intellectual toy, he insists on swinging the entire trunk wildly until the squirrels got shaken out. These 4 pieces, in total, lasted about a week, thus the reason for 3 stars."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"Great little backpack to tire your dog out while on walks. My Pomechi is a high energy dog and needed something to exhaust him during his walk. Since he was so small, we could only fill the pockets with baggies of quarters. Do be careful with the straps being too tight. They did rub on his armpits and irritated the area, but after loosening the straps, no longer had this problem."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"Better have wide chairs to use this, or kittens. I tried this with somewhat smaller dining room chairs and it does not spread the hammock out enough. Just end up with a U-shaped fabric that the cats show no interest in. Might work better with larger chairs or in a cage. I am keeping it for when I occasionally have foster cats for a week or so that stay in a cage."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"Two stars - the dog doesn't much care for it.

I normally buy only Natural Balance for my dog but I have to buy something different at times - he gets tired of the same old foods. He eats only soft/wet foods any more since he's 14yo and has had 5 teeth pulled in the past few years. I won't buy any more of this because I end up throwing half or more out."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"I wrote a previous review and gave this five stars.  I did not know this chicken was from China.  What?  We have no organic chicken in the USA?  I am so disappointed with this product.  On my packages of Dogswell there is nothing about this being ""Made in China"".  I highly regret recommending this.  I encourage people considering this product to Google this product for information."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"This is a great little setup other than the fact it is NOT 52"" tall. It is 38"" tall with a 14"" canopy ridge (which I am not using since it'll be used indoors. This should not be counted as height since I was looking for a unit where the actual height was 48"" min. A bit of false advertising. Complicating returning, we'll see if my dogs end up jumping it or not."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"I had the large size rabbit toy for my Golden Retriever. It has since been destroyed and discarded, but it was much loved by my dog for the grunting and squeaking noises. This smaller version, purchased for my parents' pugs, is not as great. There is no grunting noise, just a squeaker. It's still cute and the quality is good, but it was slightly disappointing to find no ""grunter."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,The dial and thermostat are extremely inaccurate and it will not get the water temperature above 76 degrees. When I had the dial set at 78 the heater wouldn't even turn on but when I turned it to 80 it is on continuously but never gets above 76. I'm only trying to heat 60 gallons of water and according to the description 200 watts is more than enough for that amount of water.
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"be mindful that they provide one tube, but ask you to cut it to provide the length required for two ports.  There was no point in the directions for it to tell you to cut to length for the first tube, when in fact, if you cut too long, it meant your outlet port is too short.  Shame on Fluval for cheapening out on this crucial piece for a 100+ dollar equipment."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"Very quality, so no qualms about that. Just know this is a really big pouch. So if you don't like that, then you'll want to look at something else. As a Prime member, I buy a LOT of stuff from amazon. I rely on product reviews to help me decide which product will suit my needs. I take my personal product reviews very seriously. If you found this helpful, please click yes button below."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"We loved the idea of it, so we bought it. Our first one ran out pretty fast, so we bought a can refill. It ran out over night. We decided to give it a try again, and the sprayer thing ended up breaking! 2 of them have been replaced and they both ended up just as broken. They all leak and hiss air all night long. We are done wasting money on this awful product!"
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"Went by how much my dog weighed, 55lbs. I could get it on her however I needed about 3 more inches to get around her chest to click it. Couldn't.  Donated to my vet for her to give to someone who could use it and ordered an extra large. Though it is very nicely made and like the design. Why I ordered a larger size. Just hope she can't escape out of this one."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"However, I really dislike that once it is applied to a terrarium, it cannot be removed/replaced without destroying it.  It doesn't output much heat, so for it's size, it's a little weak and I didn't end up finding it worth blocking so much visibility into my terrarium.  I suppose on a personal basis I would give it two stars, but in all fairness, it is as described as far as I can tell."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,These pants were supposed to fit a bitch who weighs 55 pounds.  I wouldn't have purchased them had I known they would be WAY too small.  I was unable to return them.  The only thing I can do next time she comes into season is to try to add some velcro straps to the pants.  If they had fit they would have been great.  Too bad - for me at least.
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"This cat tree isn't very stable. I have the bottom perch and pole in the place of the highest perch and pole. the tall pole it too wobbly for my 12 pound adolescent cat. But my cat does enjoy the center box. This gets scratched on by both my cats. For the price I would want something that looks better the common space, and was stable without modification. Go Pets has some cheap but sturdy models."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"The Dentastix are great. My dogs love them and I buy them when I can find the right price.

Although my dogs are large (70 and 78 pounds), they do not care for large treats. Therefore, I buy the medium-sized ones and they are much happier with these. They like the original flavor, although I've tried other flavors and they like them also.

Amazon's price ($54.95 for 100 sticks) is more expensive than other retailers. So, shop around."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"I purchased this size and the regular size.  My dogs are 7 lbs and 30 lbs.  While they really enjoyed these bones, they are not that durable and short lived.  I purchased them for Christmas and today, one month later, I have to throw them away because chunks are breaking off.  I would consider my pups as average to strong chewers.  I wish these bones were as durable as their competitor."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"I bought this in the small size for my son's gerbils. Although they fit on it fine, and it seemed to spin smoothly and silently when I spun it with my fingers, they could never figure out how to get it moving. Even with a full-size gerbil standing on it, it wouldn't move unless they were right on the edge. They ended up chewing the whole thing up before they ever figured out how to use it."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,I don't see how this would be good for much of anything if you at all value the picture. It's a small window.  It's a cheap plastic that loosely fits and nothing to secure anything from falling out of the bottom.  Picture and plastic falls out and mine is inside.  Outside would surely ruin any photo you would try to use.  Obviously an economic product but protecting the photo should be a fundamental feature.
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"My dogs like the food, but they also eat other dogs poop, so I'm not sure that this is a selling point.  I ordered this food and was willing to pay more because of the great reviews and the promise of being great for their skin and coat. We did not see any improvement in that area for our dogs. I would not but this again because it did not work for our dogs like I was hoping."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"I feel these are too thin. My chickens scratch them up to make a nest and all that's left is paper in the middle with no cushioning for the egg, one of the nest pads they even tore the paper. I have to put 2 nest pads on top of each other, one to be used to build the nest and the other to provide cushioning once the top pad has all the nesting material removed from the middle."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"Worked well on my medium haired cat at first, but after a couple of months the metal pins have bent a bit and the cat started to cry when being brushed -- when I test against my hand I can feel that the pins were hurting her. Not a good use of money. I'm using a grooming glove in combination with a bristle brush now and she tolerates brushing much better. Not recommended -- don't stab your cat's skin!"
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"Like some other reviewers, we had one of these purchased last April from a brick-and-mortar retailer, lasted almost a year.  Now our puppy is older, but she has chewed this one up in less than 2 weeks.  Hard to tell what the difference was; the packaging was the same.  It's disturbing to think of all the plastic she has swallowed.  The product is clearly different now, and unfortunately we will have to look for another brand."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"This flea control pill is just that: it controls/neutralizes living fleas (not fleas in any of the other 3 stages of development). The listing states that it is safe to give yout pet 1 of these every 24 hours, if necessary, but I spoke with 3 different veterinarians who all said that would be dangerous for the pet; that 2 per week would be safe. After 3 pills each, both of my cats were permanently rid of their itchy problem."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"when I started buying this litter a few years back I loved it and the price was about $14.99 but the price has doubled since then I have 7 cats and I just can't afford it anymore, it's a shame too because I liked it. But it did get heavy when you cleaned the boxes and put it out for the trash. Now I just use shredded paper and add a little to the top, it's all I can afford."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"Well , this product might be helpful for people with small pets but not for large. At least my dog ears are constantly dirty since he loves to lay on the dirt and that could be too much for these small pads. I thought this would help rather than keep on using Dab paper towel . This product doesn't do the trick for me and it's too moist which worries me if it gets inside his ear and cause infection."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"first I was super happy because they fit well. I left a 5 star review. However, the bottom part is now start to detach from the shoe only after 48 hours. I walk my dog for only 20 mins a day and he is senior. I am not sure if this happened to everyone but happened to me. I contacted amazon and I am sending them back. Sorry guys, it's a good shoe, fits well, good design, but it's not durable."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,I am a breeder of Shihtzu and got these for my girls. I wasn't overly fond of the quality. They didn't really fit well. They were baggy in the legs and they kept slipping out of them. Plus the sizes weren't really accurate. I got one for my 7 lb girl and it swam on her and my 12 lb girl could fit in it but kept slipping off so was even kind of baggy on her. I would not buy again.
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"This review is ONLY referring to the peanut butter flavored pill pockets.  (The beef and chicken flavored pill pockets are fantastic)!  The peanut butter flavored are very dry and crumble into a million pieces when I try and break them into smaller portions for my small Yorkie and Maltese.  It makes a huge mess and the dogs manage to eat the pocket and spit out the pill!  The beef and chicken, however are very moist and work perfectly!"
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"This bed might work fine at a smaller size...but the large size was very flimsy.  The sides collapse in on themselves when the dog isn't in it so it looks like a heap/mess on the floor.

It is durable enough and easy to wash...and the pillow is detached from the bed.  If the pillow isn't in the bed the whole thing really falls over.

I would not buy again and have just left the pillow out on the floor for the dogs."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"Guinea Pigs need a constant supply of hay and I gave this a go and my two piggies love it.  But NOT many Marigolds in here.  They basically fill the bag up with hay and stuff the front with some marigolds to make it look good.  Other than that false advertisement, give it a try and I'm sure you small animals will eat it all up =)

P.S.  I will never order from Petco.com again.  Thank you AMAZON."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,The worst dog beds I ever purchased. Whatever the fillings was caused my dogs to instantly tear them apart and I have never had my fur babies tear apart their beds. They didn't want to lay in them they wanted to rip them apart and that they did. I will not ever buy this type of dog bed again. Worst beds ever. I now have a different kind of bed for them that they actually want to sleep in and not rip apart.
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"Update: I have a headache and sore throat after the second day I clean the carpet with this thing. It is not a cold. I think I am allergic to whatever it is in bottle. I am just going to use water from now on. It is very powerful and everything comes out. But if you are like me, don't use a lot of chemical around the house, you may have the reaction to it too.

It works very well and smell very clean."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"Worst buy in 5 years!  The quality changed.  Straps are not finished on edge, and fray when tightened leaving the boot worthless is staying on.  The top stocking came with many snags, loose threads and eventually unraveled after 2 time of use. The stockings do not stay up and fill with massive amounts of snow.  Last, the leather toe wrap came un-stitched upon the forth time of wearing in the snow.  Broker for product handled unsatisfactory situation well."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"I gave this product two stars because of the convenience of having pouches instead of cans to deal with several times a day. It looks and smells fine to me.  We have two adult spayed female indoor cats and also feed and shelter an outdoor feral female (spayed, of course).  While they lick the gravy off the food, they really don't seem to enjoy it and most of the time there are plenty of leftovers in their dishes to toss away."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,Design is ok but this feels flimsy.  Straps and zippers not all that great.  Webbing is thin.  Item is NOT padded as pictures appear and it feels like cardboard is sewn in it - I guess to stiffen it?  I am not yet sure what happens if it gets wet but we will be seeing soon enough.  I am not confident this will hold up to use but we will see.  Really hope it will be good!
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"I hoped...and hoped...and tried this product in different combinations and sizes. On my granite tops, it's a total failure, except for the sticky residue that's lasted. Both of my climbing cats (neither are kittens), didn't care for the sticky stuff. My main jumper actually kept licking the tape. Haven't bothered trying it on cloth furniture, due to reviews. After taping $50 of this stuff, it's worthless. Perhaps for older cats, but then again, they don't jump like younger cats (not kittens in my home)"
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"Not great quality - within a few minutes my cats had ripped the toy completely off & I had to superglue it back on. Which meant that replacing the toy would not be an option. Also it's so light weight that the lightest smack knocks it over. Such a great concept & they really wanted to play with it but just not worth the money with the design the way it is.
It may work great for small kittens but do not recommend for adults."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"I have a Taiwanese Mountain Dog and she hates these treats. I break a piece off and try to feed her and she moves her head and goes ""nope nope nope"". I tried hyping up the food for her. Sometimes I would say "" Xiao Hei! Come eat!"" and I would throw her the treat (she likes to catch food in her mouth). Nope, She would catch the liver treat and then spit it out. I'm very sad. Also these treats are a little smelly."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"These are good at creating bubbles. However, they start ""shedding"" with moderate use and cleaning. My hydroponic reservoir had a little bit of algae in it, so I needed to clean the airstone as well. Bits and pieces kept coming off of it. After the cleaning, I noticed bits of the airstone falling off into the reservoir every day.

Considering these are less than a dollar each, it's not the worst thing in the world. However, I really would prefer they didn't ""shed"" into my tank."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"Terrible quality. I bought two years ago another cover without the printed dogs in an outlet store and I still have it, it was the same brand and it had a much better material. I only got to have my dogs twice in the car using this printed one and it was quickly ripped. I threw it away, my dogs are not even that hyper in the car because their car vest does not allow them to move that much. What a piece of junk!!"
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"These were the first dog poop bags I tried, mainly because they were cheap.  I did notice that a few bags had cut along the crease but other than that, the rolls were OK.  I never had any break but they are thin so I handled them carefully.  I now use a different, thicker poop bag -- just don't want to worry about a poop bag breaking or leaking while I'm carrying it or after I put it in my garbage can."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"Very confused about why I ordered two of these from the same seller but at different times (a few weeks apart) and one is made in Canada and one is made in China? Is one a fake, or did they suddenly move production to one country or another? And which country are they currently being produced in. Must say I am disappointed that  there is a discrepancy like this. Both belts are ok though so far functionality wise, but I am keeping my eyes out."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"While the ingredients are great, I have very picky bitches and neither will eat it. I even went as far as mixing their daily dosage with the entire can of their very favorite canned food, and nope, they won't touch it. Going to attempt the Bitch Pills and see if we have any luck, or will go back to OxyMate, which I firmly believe in, just wanted to give this a shot to bring in a successful heat for my older bitches last heat before retirement."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"I was getting a light flicker, or issues with it just not turning on, and when i opened it up, I noticed that the wire was exposed from rubbing on the inlet hole. I opened the second one to find the same thing.. dangerous...

I was able to cut and rewire them and no problems since.. I tossed one out in favor of a larger clip lamp from lowes which i would recommend over these due to the better quality, longer plug, higher wattage, and lower price."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"This harness is nicely made, but the clasp is small and extremely hard to open when the harness is on the dog. This clasp takes a great deal of pressure to operate, and is even hard for my husband to open.  The task is made even harder by the fact that, on my dog, the clasp ends up underneath the dog and hard to reach.  I replaced this harness with a 'step-in' vest type harness with a larger clasp that rests on the dog's back."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"These mats suck. They don't trap the litter and after two months of being flattened, they still curl up on one end. I was unfortunate enough to buy two of them.. what a waste of money. THe medium size isn't much wider than an average covered litter box. Also my cat hates it. He doesn't like to walk on it and actually jumps over it when coming out of the litter box. Hoping my new Easyology Premium Cat Litter Mats arrive soon. THey are sooo much better."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"Wheelchairs for dogs are a complex, complicated aid to use. An excellent instruction book to properly assemble the cart is required. In absence of an excellent instruction book, available customer service is necessary. When parts ""disappear"" from the assembled cart or break - customer service is necessary for parts replacement. There was no support in place for this complex product and we, sadly, were unable to attain much needed success for our old dog. Amazon made the return and refund very easy and for that, we're very grateful."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"I bought this for my French bulldog, and in terms of sizing it is perfect. However, after every walk, the front gets loosened up and I have to retighten it. And my dog isn't much of a puller either. I thought that the fact that this didn't have a martingale contraption in the front would make it better, but it seems a little awkward when pulling on the side. As far as mitigating pulling, it does do it's job better than a regular collar, but I'm not sure it's enough."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,My crazy cats get litter everywhere even with the CatIT domed and covered litter box (which is the best box ever! Really helps to control odors!). I bought this pan mat to see if it would help. There is about 75% less litter on the floor around the box but still some getting on the floor around the mat.  Maybe my cats practicing their long jumps. Maybe they are doing it on purpose because they love to watch me sweep.  The mat is easy to clean and durable.
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"I absolutely loved this tag for all of about a day. I left my dog alone for 30 minutes and she ate it! She won't let me have things. I loved this because it was not metal and didn't clank constantly. Unfortunately - with it not being metal, my a-hole dog ate it. Im so sad. Again, I loved this. It was so pretty and much larger than I even expected. :( Ill just cry now. (I have to go back to metal) I suppose it just isn't durable enough."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"The first month it was great, then the wheels on the bus fell off as Its made of cheap plastic fittings which leak, inlet value leaks on inside and drips on floor. The drain leaks as the ""O"" ring was/is to small, so I bought a second ""O"" ring from Home Depot and stopped it from leaking out of drain outlet, now it leaks around the drain. Its junk threw in trash and replaced with 4 gallon jug waterier, not as convenient but at least its not dripping on the floor."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"Even though this is the best value rat pellets for the price, it is not worth it. No matter if they're bought in-store or online about a half pound of it arrives crushed into dust. The blue/green pellets give my rats brightly colored and very soft poop, plus they hate eating the green stuff! So in reality after subtracting the dust and the green pellets, you're really only getting maybe 3 pounds worth of useable food. Considering how it affects my rat's bowel movements, I don't think it's safe to use."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"My cats do not like this item, but it was the only one that I  could find that didn't require securing the shelf with suction cups on the window (a very poor idea, suction cups give way and don't work well on older Windows in older homes.  I was able to secure to the window sill with screws provided and for now it seems stable enough.  The tiny pieces of hook and loop tape provided are a ridiculous way to secure. I guess it's comparable with the cost."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,We were concerned about our cats peeing on the bath rugs.  This litter didn't seem to attract them but changing their litter pans definitely helped.  We got rid of the old covered litter pans and now use big plastic storage containers.  We cut out a u-shaped entrance for them.  They love the new litter pans and use them instead of the rugs.  We use clumping cat litter but the type doesn't seem to matter so we go with the cat litter from Aldi's -- very reasonably priced.
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"What a disappointment. Where on earth are the quality products?  This pump is way too weak, and it is completely unreliable during a power outage.  Even when plugged in, the air flow is not strong enough and on battery power is non existent, if you can get it to work. I tested it a couple of times, and the third time it just didn't work at all. It's going back at lightning speed. My cheap battery backup is more than enough. Don't waste your money and risk your fish life."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"Although when I received the product all the pre-drilled holes weren't there, the company was prompt with response and everything was settled. Assembly by myself only took 15 minutes, very easy to build and very easy to clean! I do recommend if people have a severe allergy to wood they not get this. I opened the box and immediately had a asthma attack! But it is very nice and sturdy, has two decent size levels. I have to female rabbits that live in it and they are more then comfortable in it!"
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"These are no longer made in the USA.  My most recent purchase - the bag looks different, and they have a very strong odor, which they didn't before.  The bag now clearly states they're made in China.  I decided to let my dog eat these but not to reorder since I only want products exclusively made in the USA, and my dog doesn't even really like them as much, so I'm going to end up throwing away more than half of the bag.  I won't be ordering these again"
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"Bought an All Glass top 30 years ago identical to this one. The glass hood fit perfect.

However the semi transparent plastic gap filler in the back is not deep enough to fully go to the back of the aquarium. I will be calling the manufacturer and see what is going on. I have an Aqueon 29 gallon tank so it's no mystery that this shouldn't be a good fit. Was hoping that was the case anyway.

20 years ago the fit was perfect. I think the glass size has changed. This must be fixed Aqueon."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"My dog got very bad diarrhea from just one treat. I had been using Vetri Science and she was fine  but  didn't love the taste so I  decided to try these. I'm going back to Vetri Science, they didn't make her sick.  I would like to say that for customer service I would give Paw Choice a 5 star. I was contacted by David and he generated a full refund without me asking.  The product seems to work for many pets, it just didn't agree with my dog's system."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"my kitten straight up refused to eat this. i offered it to him several times on different days and occasions. the most he did was bat it around a couple of times.

to put it into context, he is NOT a picky eater AT ALL--- i feed him several types/brands of cat food- both wet and dry, and he EATS IT ALL-- i've yet to come across something he doesn't eat. i don't know what ingredient in this thing turns him off so much, but i feel like i wasted good money buying him something he hates."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"I contacted the seller about being shipped the wrong order the day after I got this product, to tell them it was not what I ordered. I ordered the anti diarrheal paste. I never got a reply and it's been over a month. What is did get was Vetoquinol 410816 Pro-Pectalin?,30 cc not for Diarrheal at all...What I ordered was Vet Solutions Pro-Pectalin Anti-Diarrheal Gel for Dogs & Cats, 30cc  I did try it one time it, made my cat throw up and more lose stools. So I will not be ordering from this company again."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,I have no choice than to buy this replacement flap as I don't want to buy a new door.  I have used Pet Safe doors for 20 yrs and the double flap was the best.  This flap leaks around the sides as there are no magnets on the sides  and the magnets on the bottom  definitely don't hold it in the wind.  I have two big dogs a great dane and a Doberman and I have to buy a new flap every winter as it tears along the edge by late summer.
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"Came with a strong repellent plastic smell and it was folded in the bag so hard that it flattened over a month's time. It could be either the reason why my cat first willingly got on it after 3 weeks. And albeit on my bed, it's now still competing with my pillow and comforter and my face for my cat's butt.
The power is really low. Covering a comforter on it all day cannot raise the temperature for me to feel very warm so I doubt it makes a difference for cats who have higher body temperature than human"
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"My German Shepherd is notoriously hard on toys, but I had high hopes for this bear since the Megalast balls are so durable. Unfortunately, this does not live up to the Megalast name. The squeaker called it quits after about five minutes (it was pushed back into the bear & rattling around), and almost the entire toy became bear confetti all over the living room within an hour. The only thing durable about this was the base of the bear--my dog still likes to play fetch with the rectangular piece that was once this poor gummi bear's legs."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"I know this works great for other dogs, but it just didn't work for mine. After weeks of getting him acclimated to the gentle leader inside, giving him lots of treats and attention, he loved it inside, but couldn't handle it on the actual walk. It made his behavior much worse- he would throw temper tantrums and just lie down on the walk, refusing to get up. After many adjustments, he was still able to get the nose part off every time. Maybe it's just the shape of his muzzle. One good thing is that he did walk by my side!"
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"I can honestly say, I do not know if this product works or not.  It really STINKS!!! STINKS!! Even before I remove the cap and seal!!! The Durvet Nu-Stock Ointment might work well, but I guess it's best if used on livestocks and out-door pets.  Definitely not recommended if you have an indoor pet.  My poor dog stinks up my apartment and I only used a small amount on his skin.

I will NOT recommend for indoor use at all.

The ointment was tossed in the trash!! Not using that stuff then have that lingering toxic odor in an enclosed area."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"This toy is insanely small. The opening was extremely small and I bought this for my tiny female rat and she couldn't even get half her body into this. Any bird that was given this as a toy would have to be very small because this toy is ridiculously small. So small I think a mouse might fit inside it, and that's a big... might fit inside it. Even if my rat had fit inside this, I wouldn't have let her have it because it's made so cheaply. A few bites in the right places and this entire thing would have fallen apart."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"i had a problem with fleas on my indoor cat from dogs and tried this and things did not change so i returned this to Amazon and with cats being as sensitive as they are I ran out of option...until......my granddaughter came home from school with lice and her mother found found LiceGuard Robicomb Lice Zapping Comb that removes lice and eggs.
Well...it also removes fleas...you see a spark when a large flea is hit the smaller ones even though it doesn't spark it does kill them.
Im very sold on this zapper and as far as my cat no more scratching her neck, immediately"
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"I used this waterer for several months. I had always rinsed it out with fresh water before refilling it, and scrubbed the bottom part. Within 2 days, the bottom part would always start growing an orange slime on it, and I smelled the plastic water-holder part, and it smells like algae (although none is visible). I feel awful for using this product for my cat, and have switched to a regular bowl that I can thoroughly clean daily. I am only keeping the automatic water dish in the event I'm away a day or two. Other than that, DO NOT USE FOR DAILY WATER."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"There are 2 cords with small balls at the end - just the right size to block a cat's windpipe or esophagus. My petite sissy cat grabbed one of the balls in his teeth and pulled it off. Luckily, he dropped it. I promptly cut off the cords with the balls. The cats seem to like it okay, but it's early days. I don't know how long the big ball will last, and I will not leave the toy alone with them ever, or let it get too chewed. PLEASE CUT OFF THE CORDS WITH THE SMALL BALLS! It could mean your cat's life."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"I sue these dogs beds as a liner for my dog's cots.  This is what I was looking for to place on top of the dog cots so they are not laying on the rougher mesh surface of the cot.  They fit the large cots well.  They are a too thin to use alone as a dog bed.  They fit well in a large wire kennel but they are still a little to thin for comfort for my older dogs.  I have not washed them but I tumble them in the dryer to freshen, fluff and remove dog hair."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"I bought the small size, thinking it would be smaller and thinner than the image shown with the full grown dog.  I bought it for a friend's King Charles Spaniel but this collar is very wide and seems heavy. It is also difficult to adjust to make smaller around the neck.  I was going to return it but I gave it to a friend who had a large dog instead.  Because I gave it away I am not sure how good the USB charger is.  But the light seemed bright the first day I got it.  Only for large dogs."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"So...my puppy has accidents and I've tried so many things. Of course I try this because it has high reviews but a gallon later I'm still not impressed. I don't like the scent of it and it seems to linger even after I clean the carpet. I really don't think it destroys the urine smell like one of the other products that I use. I'll use it until it's gone then it's back to the previous brand I guess. No sticky residue on the carpet afterwards, I just don't think it's the best and destroying urine order and I don't like the scent of it."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"I was a little disappointed with this item. My cat loves her dart & she's an even bigger sucker for string; her last string arm toy she completely destroyed - she's not very gentle with her ""prey"", so I was delighted to see this string almost completely incased in a plastic compartment. Unfortunately the string doesn't move sporadically in the manner that the dart varies in speed & quickly changes direction. This toy goes one speed, one direction. Pretty boring & predictable, my cat just times the string then grabs it & drags the entire toy around the house with her as it struggles & whirs."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"This is a GRAPE WOOD piece and only suitable for dry (desert) habitat tanks.  I bought it assuming that it was manzanita, ghostwood, Mopani,or another wood suitable for medium / higher humidity tanks but it is not.  If you are looking for something for a higher humidity setup (crested / gargoyle geckos, day geckos, frogs, etc.  then get something else.  This would only be suitable for a leopard gecko, tortoise, bearded dragon or other similar dry setup.  IMO Amazon needs to change the description to state what type of wood it is so that people would be better informed before buying it."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"So normally with cat carriers you have to do a little extra to make sure they can't wiggle out of them. Usually carriers have a couple double zippers, I'll use a little clip on the main zipper, and the others have to be zip tied. This carrier comes with a zipper on the side that can't really be secured because it's not a double zipper. I had to zip tie it to the handle and my cat was still giving me a run for my money trying to squeeze out. Too late to return it since it's used, but I wouldn't recommend it for cats, especially sneaky ones."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"Save your money! It's a great idea, but the manufacture of this item is very, very bad. The base is light, cheap plastic. No weight to it and no way it will stand up to play with a kitten, let alone an adult cat. In the 20 minutes we first put it down, we had to come back and turn it upright again FOURTEEN TIMES! The cats had fun with it until it tipped over again. We sure got our exercise running back and forth to fix it when the kitties began to squawk about it not working. I don't have time for this. We'll get them something else."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"Only 3 bones in this small bag maybe to keep the costs down I am not sure. I gave one to my dog he put it in his mouth and dropped it and went and sat on another side of the room. So I brought it to him when he was sitting down and gave it to him and he suprisingly ate it but ate it too quickly and threw half of it up. That was enough for me and I threw the rest of them in the garbage.

Too bad I have tried Rachael Ray dog food in the past and my dog loved that but this was a flop."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"I feed many stray cats on a regular basis.  Some of them can eat many cans a day eating you out of house and home, but this brand of Natural Balance even stray cats won't touch.  Too bad.  I put some of this out and they didn't even touch it though some of them hadn't had much to eat that day.  It is also very very dry, the kitties will needs tons of water just to digest this stuff.  I also had this one in Venison/Buffalo, and they wouldn't even touch that one.  I think the neighborhood skunks and raccoons ended up eating it."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,This was nice sized but unlike other kong toys is not durable at all.  My 50 lb wirehaired pointer destroyed it in 5 minutes.  The other kong stuffed animals have been awesome.  They still destroy them but it takes a while - like 3 weeks for that to happen.  I will stay with the real tough kong toys.  I don't recommend this toy to any dog that plays somewhat rough - it will not last.  Additional squeakers are a nice thought but they also present a hazard if they can be removed from the toy.  Overall not real impressed with this kong toy.
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"I started with the most expensive, all natural cat foods when I got my kitty; but he wouldn't eat anything. Some dry foods I had better luck than any of the can stuff. But he really likes the Fancy Feast Grilled can foods. the grilled seems to be the only thing my fussy cat will eat ... he won't even eat a can of MY tuna.
It does have by products, gluten and artificial flavoring, which doesn't really make me happy; still, he does eat it all gone and I've tried them all, These cans are the perfect size, no waste. My cat won't eat a can food that has been refrigerated."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"this is by far the creepiest dog toy ive ever had. and its really hard plastic. so not only does it make a ton of noise when it rolls around or is thrown but the sound effects are CREEPY! and it will randomly go off when u walk in the room or near the dog toy box. so imagine u are still half asleep, its dark out and im going to go feed the dogs, i reach in the dog food container and bump it and then i hear a creepy voice say something weird out of no where. do not buy unless you are getting it for someone else lol!"
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"I ordered two sizes: medium and small. The medium sized socks were a perfect fit for my dog's front paws, but too large for the back paws. These are the only things he'd wear on his feet. I tried the more expensive shoes/boots, and he hated them. These are much easier to put on, and they stay on. I only wish the soles were thicker. I bought them so I can take him out during the day to ""go"" in the Phoenix heat. While these protect his feet, I worry they aren't enough. So RC Pet Products, make a product with a thick rubber sole and you'll have more of my money!"
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,I put my bull dog on this product and was certainly seeing nice muscle tone but my dog is pretty sensitive and she started getting acid reflux and having issues so I was not able to continue using the product but I would say for the couple weeks she was able to use it I did notice good result with her body structure and her energy levels were nice and her skin and coat looked good. She has a lot of allergies naturally so this just wasn't something she could take but if you don't have a sensitive dog I would recommend it because it does have great ingredients and no fillers.
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"I was looking for a ball my collie couldn't destroy (she tears apart everything and has a special obsession with balls). This ball seems well made, but it is very large and not pliable enough to where she can pick it up. She pushed it around the living room for the first afternoon, but then gave up and never touched it again. I ended up bringing it over to a friends house for his much larger retriever and even she could barely fit this in her mouth. I ordered the 6-inch diameter ball and I suspect this would be great for a big dog with a large mouth, but didn't work for my dog."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"Too small. Using the measuring chart, the sizing is incorrect. Consider next size up.  Good luck, I will update comment after reordering the next larger size.

I reordered the sun visors in size small and they are a much better fit .  I Do not know if the bill on the visor is long enough to really shade the shih tzu eyes but will know better during actual outside wear.  The velcro strap may be an issue as well.  It is a little awkward to put in place and tends to get tangled with the ear and face.  They are cute though.  We will have to see how really functional they are."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"The very first time I put my dog's food in this dish he ate a couple bites then grabbed the bottom edge of the bowl and flipped it over to eat the food off the floor. Then (because it did not occur to me to put the bowl on a high shelf) he very quickly chewed all the rubbery non-skid stuff off the bottom of the bowl. He is not really a problem chewer so I think something about this bowl is just too appealing for dogs to resist eating the whole thing. I was just stupid to consider a plastic bowl as safe for a dog, but the pet company who made it is absolutely irresponsible."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"This dog bowl is super cute!  Very colorful, and l like the idea of the removable inner stainless steel bowl.  (Prevents allergies to plastic in pups).  The size is perfect for small dogs, it fits on my hand to give an idea of size.
Cons:  I was not happy that the outer plastic bowl came scratched.  It wasn't packaged well and because it is an add-on item it probably was not handled gently.
Other then the aesthetic flaw from handling, I really do like this bowl.  It does leave me with a feeling this product will not keep its cute looks over time though so I reduced the stars on rating, because of that reason."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"We thought this was our answer to a pulling GSD. Not so, had to go back to the prong once he learned how to tolerate the pressure on his neck. Seemed to work fine at first with the positive treat reinforcement, but he soon went back to his old ways. With that and the strap over his nose started to rub the fur off his snout, we stopped using it. May work for a dog that is not as stubborn as ours. It gets 2 starts for the valiant attempt and that it seems to be made well.  You will need to wash it with soap and hot water once in awhile, it can get a little stinky."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"Well, they are okay plants.  The rooted ones seem to be doing really well, the stem plants were very thin and a lot of them haven't survived past their melt.  I'd say all in all I really got about 50% good healthy plants by then end.  It wasn't a bad price and selection if you want to get an bunch to start off with, just don't expect the big lush plants like you see in the pictures.  The price is still better, even at that percentage than the cost at the pet store, so all in all it was worth it, but look at it from the same point of you if you purchase the set."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"Bought these on prime day.  My dog is 4 yo, 80lbs, eats a high protein, grain free food, and has never been sick in his life. Gave him one a day since received them. Woke up to him pacing,  rubbing his head all over ground,  vomiting blood, stool on hardwood (never had accident inside in years). Blood in stool. Vomiting and neurological symptoms through day.  Took him to emerg vet. Whole body bright red,  blood in ears. $800 later... and a night of iv fluids, IV antibiotics,  anti diarrhea, pain meds... and labs showing liver enzymes off the charts...  it appears I've fallen victim to poison dog treats. Will be taking further measures.  Beware."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"Collar works as advertised, but I do not recommend the shock portion. Ive had other shock collars for my wild dog and bought this one as a replacement for one that ate batteries. The shock option literally burned my dogs skin and caused a sore. i did not realize until a couple of days later after i took the collar off to adjust it. I have never had this happen before with other collars and would compare it burns left by a cattle prode. Even at a low setting, my dog yelped. I am an owner who uses this to correct bad behavior, not to torture. Im pretty sad that this thing is so extreme but the vibration and noise settings are just fine."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"My cats gave this product a sniff and moved on. I placed the catnip in the bloom part and positioned it in the CENTER of their play area. They skirted around it. It sat there for a week. I moved it next to their ball pit which they love hoping it would engage them. The ignored it.  The only attention it has gotten was from the dog who peed on it. :l
It is very small, only a kitten would fir on this with any comfort. It doesn't feel comfortable at all, The padding is thin.
I tried to give it to the gunie pig who was about as interested as the cats.
Really just  a piece of plastic for highly bored felines, if that."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"My cat needed lysine - but she didn't like it in any form (capsule mixed into her food, gel, chew).  This one was the best - she will eat it sometimes, if I break it into 2-3 pieces, unlike the vet's chews, which cost a good deal more and were completely rejected.  This one is a little softer, and the smell appears to be better, from my cat's reaction, so it's a partial success.

Update:  (July 12)  She no longer will eat it, and the negative review regarding Consumer Labs' findings about this supplement convinced me not to try to persuade her...sometimes my cats have a good sense of what is healthy for them (or maybe she just doesn't like the taste/smell that much)."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"Not for heavy use but will be okay for the several times I will need to use it for a 6 pound dog with a quiet disposition.
What is horrible though is the too shorter handle.  What do they think all people are between 3 and 4 feet tall with very long arms.?
Ridiculous and weak telescoping handle but as I said this will not be used often.
I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT as it is only fairly well made and though spacious for a small animal has no real substantial comfort to the included comfort pad and is somewhat cheaply made.
I refuse to deal with the likes of the manufacturer and so will find a better made case by a more customer friendly dealer in the future"
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"I'm not sure if my cat is not that bright or not that interested. I loaded one of these with treats and gave it to him. He smelled it, licked the outside and left. I showed him how it works and gave it to him again. He just looked at me and meowed. I haven't been able to get him to use them at all. If he wasn't a smart cat i could understand, but his very clever. He figured out that constantly pawing at my kitchen cabinets will get them to open so he can go inside. He also figured out that he can jump up and turn a door nob to get into closed rooms. I think he just doesn't like to play with balls. Go figure."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"These are wonderful chew toys.  They do not splinter. Do not smell and the dog loves them.  However, they love them so much they chew and chew to get to the marrow and my daughter's dog ended up with 2 fractured top molars.  She was at my house and said Maggie wasn't chewing on the bone anymore and every once in a while she'd give a cry, like something hurt her.  I looked in her mouth and her teeth didn't look bad but one was definitely broken in the back.  She took her to the vet the next day and now they have a huge dental bill to pull the teeth.  So aside from the fractured teeth, pain and huge vet bill........I guess they are just fine."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"Does not work as tartar remover but does give my pug a better minty breath. He didn't mind the taste of the water. It's pug, he will eat or drink just about anything. My cats however will not have anything to do with anywater with this in it. My cat become very obsessed about the faucet very time I wash my hand. They think it's the only source to the water after I put this thing in their drinking water. Tip to pug owner, pug sometimes stink and it's not their breath, it's the stuff stuck under their folded skin so please clean their face more often. Also I bought a stuff call prodent plaqueoff, it's about the only thing really work for tartar removal. Takes a longtime for it to work though."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"Wow. Our PetSmart trainer actually recommended this one and what a terrible idea that was. First I'd like to mention that it does not come with the batteries so don't forget to buy those. Actually, don't buy those because this will probably go right into the garbage.

The noise is audible to people. Barely, but you can hear it. The noise is really high-pitched and irritating so instead of making my dog shut up, it just made him bark louder. You know how most dogs are with vacuum cleaners? That's how my dog is with the Bark-Off. He'll chase after it and bark bark bark until I turn it off. I tried leaving him alone with it on and it only agitated him further and made his anxiety worse. Save your couple bucks for something else."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"I buy (subscription) other Beyond canned foods but when I opened Beef & Spinach and I thought it must be spoiled. It had such a rotten smell, I opened 2 more cans to compare. They, too, smelled rotten - like a decayed tooth.  My dog didn't seem averse to the smell, but she's a rescued dog & will probably eat anything.  With some trepidation I gave her some.  Several hours later she had terrible gas, followed by diarrhea.  She has no problem w other flavors.
Also, I agree w those who have complained about packaging. Several deliveries have come damaged: light-weight  boxes torn, 3 cases per box so heavy postal person couldn't carry them to the house. Last week the cans were so dented some  actually were bent in the middle."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"I can't fathom how the glowing reviews on this product could possibly be real. I just received mine yesterday, just in time to pick my cat up from the vet, after having surgery.

I live in New York City so I don't have a car, and probably wheel it around more than most people will. The shoulder straps for the carrier can't be removed. When you wheel this carrier around, the straps get caught in the wheels. After wheeling it around for 6 blocks, the straps were literally shredded.

The clasps for the removable shoulder strap is made of VERY cheap plastic, rather than metal so you have to be very careful with it, otherwise the plastic will snap.

I would NOT recommend buying this carrier. I've had it for 24 hours, and it already looks like it's years old."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"My Bichon has luxating patellas and the Vet recommended this as well as Dasaquin.  I had great hope for this product.  The first chew  she ate with no trouble.  Subsequently, she refused the supposedly chewable chews.  I tried sneaking it into peanut butter but again she refused any parts of it.....Breaking them up to hide them in liverwurst was an unbelievable ordeal.  I needed an automotive mallet and would have to keep hammering away....crazy.... tried breaking it up in my Braun spice grinder but that chew still wouldn't crumble and it broke my spice grinder!  So, I'm stuck with a really expensive product with no way of making it palatable.....
I'm going to try the Cosequin DS with MSM chewables tablets......Hopefully, they can be broken down if my fur baby doesn't cooperate."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"The Bottoms Up was difficult for us, probably because of the 65 pound weight of our dog. I imagine it would be much easier with a smaller dog. Holding that much weight with just one arm is tough, and we guessed that the straps weren't comfortable for the dog.  Having to put it on each time we took him out wasn't convenient either.
We switched to a harness that fits on the back somewhat like a girdle. We put it on in the morning and it stays on all day. All we have to do to go out is to snap handles on. And, since there's two handles we can share the load. I'm sure it's more comfortable for the dog since the weight is distributed over a large area, rather than the two straps on the Bottoms Up."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"I love lava lamps, but this is a terrible ""tank"" for a Betta. It is much too small, the bubbles will be too strong and move the water more than a Betta will like, and there is no room at the top for them to breath. And from other reviews, the cap on this is air-tight. Your fish will suffocate (all fish require oxygen, it's dissolved in the water and without any air holes, there will be no oxygen. ) And if it is air-tight, the bubbles will increase the pressure inside the ""tank"", leading to stressing the material and the fish which is under the water. If you want this as a novelty light, go ahead. It's ridiculously overpriced for that (you can get a small real lava lamp for 1/3rd the price) but do not use it for a fish ""tank."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,If I could give this 0 stars I would. We have 2 cats and 2 litter pans making us have to change the litter once a week. This stuff clumps and is ultra fine making it nearly impossible to scoop because half the pan becomes like solid clay when liquid is introduced and the litter gets everywhere. We now have to change the litter about every 2-3 days. I will never recommend this garbage to anyone and will never buy it again. With how many good reviews and buys this had I was really excited but all we got was a tiny bag and complete disappointment. If you have more things to do with your life rather than changing litter every waking hour of the day this litter isn't for you. I wouldn't even spit in the general direction of this crap.
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"I broke down and bought this mat in a fit of desperation because I was sick and tired of the sheer amount of litter and waste my two 4-5 month old kittens were tracking everywhere BUT inside their litter box! At first it worked relatively well, though the indentations are pretty shallow and don't catch everything. But then my kittens took to picking at the mat, which caused the PVC to shred. So then in addition to the usual tracking of litter and waste, there were also little PVC particles everywhere! I am still finding it all over the house.

So for me, this mat did not work well. However, I do want to add the disclaimer that if you have older cats, or just cats who are not interested in picking at the PVC material, this mat might work better for you."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"I love the idea of the automatic litter box but mine broke after only a few months. Now the light just blinks and I have to push it in order for it to rake the litter. The whole point of it was to make my cat's lives better when I'm not around but now that's not happening. I also scoop out what does get raked into the holding box every couple days since there is a smell.
The litter itself is ok. It doesn't really absorb the cat urine so I try to scoop that out when I clean their box. I may try filling the cartridge with a different litter next time to see if that will work. I think clumping litter would be better anyway since it would get raked into the box and be easier to get rid of the smell."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"I am so angry. Frontline DOES NOT WORK. Idk where all these people live that frontline actually works, but they must not have many ticks. We live in upstate New York, where there are lots of ticks. I thought I was being a responsible dog owner and religously following the instructions and applying frontline. Our puppy still came in with ticks after walks or after playing in the yard, and now she has lymes disease and goes through boughts of not being able to move. We had pay for expensive blood work and antibiotics. And she'll have this disease for the rest of her life. She isn't even 1 year old. My puppy got lymes thanks to frontline NOT WORKING. We switched to the seresto collar and its MUCH better! Dont waste your money on frontline. I have half a mind to sue them."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"The concept of the playpen for the pet is nice, yet the workmanship leave much to be desired!
I purchased this for a new puppy and immediately thought it was a unique, easy to manipulate product.
This was short lived with each time I removed and replaced a stake in the attaching wall units. I first found my puppy chewing on the top cap that this company merely attaches by hand with no adhesive to ensure safety issues such as this. I wasn't happy to find an item my dog could have choked on in her ""safety"" area; I simply reattached it using crazy glue. The next morning I found an new one on the ground in his dog bed that he had thankfully hadn't found. Needless to say, this ""Exercise Playpen"" is now in the garbage. WARNING -this is not a safe product for any animal!!!"
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,As it comes it is not much use.  Like others I replaced the sand paper like covering with carpet with double faced tape.  Another negative is that if you are using this in your driveway the thing will slip right off the car unless you are supporting it.  There are no rubber feet or anything to help it grab the surface.  With my 80 pound lab it is very difficult to guide him while holding the ramp in place with my foot. He is finally getting used to it but it has slipped out from under him twice causing him to be very wary of it.  Not sure how to remedy that.  But when it works it is very helpful. I cannot lift my 10 year old boy into the car and as he ages he (WE) will need it more and more.
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"I loved this when I first got it, easy to set up and looked great!  After a couple of days of suspicious distrust, they tried and and liked it. It became the favorite.  But after about 6 months the plastic piece that holds the hinge pin broke.  I tried to use it with just the one hinge but it was obvious that it would break too. They are made of plastic. For a litter box that cost almost $100 I would expect hinges that were made to last.  Some of the reviews I've seen show people actually placing these in living areas, with the door discreetly turned to the side. But after the hinges break and the door comes off it is not so attractive, have included pics. Will be moving to a bigger house so will need another litter box. I think I'll look at some other ones."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"I got this for my Golden Retriever pup when she got spayed.  It fit the neck almost perfectly (she's at about 12 inches, so I got the medium).  It's very soft and pretty comfy.  It didn't bother her at all.

The problem is that as a larger breed, she was simply too long.  She could easily curl her body enough that she could get to the stitches around the donut without much of a problem at all.  So it was pretty useless for it's intended purpose.  But that's partly my fault for getting the wrong size.  It would have helped if they listed the outer diameter of the donut as well.  For reference, the medium is about 10-11 inches wide on the pup.  The donut itself is about 3.75 inches fully inflated.

So if you have a larger breed, absolutely go a size (or more) higher."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"I use this with the larger size bowl, but the smaller one makes a nice extra cup for my purse or glove department. With the bottle, it does bounce on my leg while walking, but not enough that I notice it. It's really nice to use on a walk.

06/15/15 I'm changing my rating from five stars to three because the water bottle now falls out of the loop. I guess I've used it enough that the hole has stretched and it bounces enough that the water bottle works its way out of the holder and falls. I've tried just taking a half full bottle, and it still falls out. This started out really nice, but now won't work for me.

Maybe if attached to something that doesn't bounce as much, such as a knapsack, it would still work fine. But I only use a fanny pack when walking my dog, so it's attached to that."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"My dog has arthritis and Cushing disease, so she takes several medications three times each day.  Pill pocket flavor matters big time here, making the difference between her swallowing meds eagerly versus engaging in repeated  wrestling matches to gag the same pills down her.  My dog occasionally will eat the chicken flavor -- for one pill only.  She spits subsequent doses out right away -- or she picks at the pocket but leaves the pill behind, which puts us back to the wrestling routine.  I have much more consistent success with getting her to swallow meds eagerly if I consistently use the pea/duck flavor Pill Pockets.  Personally, I think those smell like rotten who knows what, but she loves the pea/duck flavor, and that's what matters.  It's a no brainer at my house; I've learned to put the pea/duck version on rotating order and hold my nose."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"I have been looking for a possible change in food. I already get a high quality food natural food. This review/posting is to inform customers looking to get a natural dog food. This food uses Rosemary Extract as an ingredient. Please be aware that this causes seizures in dogs and cats, of any size. I 65lb pit bull died on the table twice because of a food with this ingredient. He is ok now, and since taking him off rosemary extract he has had no seizures in 4 years. Just google rosemary extract dog and you will see.

http://www.thedogpress.com/dogfood/Rosemary-Neurotoxin-10032_Liquorman.asp

The companies only add this ingredient for us to read and to capitalize on out perception of natural. They add things that they do not test or care about other than to sell you on it. There are many other good companies out there that do care and do not use this sales ingredient. Hopefully this review saves at least one animal."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"My veterinarian recommended this product for my dog who has an intervertebral disc problem.  She does not have arthritis. My dog was also given a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent, rimadyl, for a month, and put on restricted walking. These are probably responsible for my dog getting better. I don't know, and there is no way I Can know, if the Phycox has had a beneficial effect on my dog.  I do know that the Phycox claim to fame is its content of phycocyanin.  However, a chewable contains at most 40 mg of phycocyanin.  The studies of phycocyanin that they list on their website, which were done in Cuba and on Rats, showed a benefit when the rats were given between 100-300 mg per kg.  At 37 lbs, my dog is about 17 kg, which means that she would need 1700-5100 mg of phycocyanin per day to get the same benefit. So it is unlikely that my dog will benefit much from this particular product."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"BEWARE!!!!!! THIS PRODUCT CAN CAUSE YOUR DOG HARM!!

I purchased this product because of the great reviews, even though I normally use Frontline. I followed instructions on the weight requirements, as well as where to place the liquid. About an hour after application, my dog started freaking out! He acted like he wanted to jump out of his skin! Running around, stopping, itching, whimpering, acting anxious, etc! I started reading all of the 1-2 star reviews on amazon and was shocked!! Poor dogs having seizures and needing to be hospitalized over this product!! I immediately washed my dog twice with Dawn! Then, gave him some Benadryl to help make him more comfortable! Finally after 45 minutes he was able to sit still and sleep since the Benadryl made him a little drowsy.. The next day he was still acting weird, itchy, uncomfortable etc. DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT!! Use Frontline! Frontline does not have the ingredient Permethrin, which can be toxic for your dogs! Someone should be suing this company!!"
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"Your mileage may vary... The 1st two orders were great. Pate, like anyone would find for their cat or dog.

HOWEVER, my last batch was itchy, gooey, and gross.  My cats still eat the crud, but now with them having to clean their tongue of the gooey mess it is.

I JUST ORDERED 2 NEW CASES, so if they are like the last batch. They are going back to Amazon because of crap quality control.

I gave this product 5 stars earlier, however, their last product sucked!!!

To sum it up... Great ingredients, and great for your cats. But how about not making it gooey stinking goop?

You need better quality control. My cats are about to give up on this food because it comes out as goo. I've even put it in the refrigerator, and it's still the same goop.

I will post later, and if I got the same goop as before.... I'm sending it back.

SHAME ON YOU ""NATURAL BALANCE""!!!!  If these cans are bad, you'll never have my business again!!!"
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,I have had Drinkwells for years my cats and dog love them but after many years the cat one stopped .Thought I would try something different for a change.  - it has no fountain like the drinkwell .Maybe my fault for not realizing that . Water comes out over the dome . They and i  miss the fountain effect .It is very noisy if  you let water get low which is very easy with 4 cats . Their is no resovior option so if you have a few animals it does not last It has a tiny hole to fill the water . My cats do not seem to be thrilled with it  and go to the Bigdog Drinkwell now . I think if you are used to the drinkwell you may not like this . I will be buying them a drinkwell again . Yes it is a bit easier to clean and I like how it collects any debris but ... Drinkwell it isn't !
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"Pretty silly cat toy, silly as in pointless. Concept is great, so I listened to the 5 star reviews and asked for this as a gift. From the minute I pressed the power button and the thing started moving, I knew it would be a huge disappointment. It makes an annoying sound, but the worst part is that the laser movement is super rigid and not natural at all. It basically just moves back and forth along in a circular pattern. You can make this pattern large or small, but it otherwise does not change. I'm also not even sure why they provide a ""manual"" mode, as that's no different than a normal small laser pointer, except instead you're holding a gigantic bowling pin and feeling a bit like an idiot. :P Needless to say, my cats also thought this toy was useless. My super playful kitten (loooooves chasing the ""red dot""), tried to chase it for a minute or two, but after a while got bored with the movement and just abandoned the thing."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"Normally I feed my cats Fromm Four Star dry foods but I was looking for something a little more budget friendly available with Prime shipping that was still a better brand. With four cats it gets expensive! After doing some research I found Earthborn which fit the bill. Normally 3 out of 4 of my cats are not picky so I wasn't worried about them liking it. However my cats had different plans - they ALL refuse to eat it. It's been a game of chicken over the last couple of weeks with me refusing to buy any other brand and my cats loudly voicing their displeasure with this food. I finally gave in and bought another brand because I was sure they were plotting my death! I don't know whether it tastes horrible or bland, or if it's the tiny kibble that turns them off. Since they hate it, the only compliment I can give it is the bag I received had a slider to close the packaging to keep the kibble fresh. I wish more brands did this."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"I really wish this fountain worked out. I love the concept of the water dish being separated from the food dish. It minimizes food crumbs in the water and one fountain can be used for the whole herd of pets.

This little thing was terrible. First, it leaked. I was unable, for a while, to find the source of the leak or fix it. It soaked through several towels and left a water stain on my beautiful hardwood floors.  I found a few online forums that had the same issue. I checked to make sure it was level, there were no holes, and it wasn't over full.  Well it filled up right to the brim, but it was leaking from the flimsy reserve add on tank. I ended up removing it but it was still leaking a little.

Maybe a day after the leaking issue was temporarily fixed, it just stopped working. It was plugged up, the very faint buzz from the adapter was there, but the water refused to flow.  I'm in the process of returning this now. Definitely am expensive waste."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"Not even sure I should really give this 3 stars. It had absolutely no effect on my cat. I can't say it was ""bad"" so I gave it the 3 just as a point of neutrality, which is to say nothing happened. Cats are funny though- maybe it's just my cat. I tried it, but she didn't even raise her nose or twitch a whisker. It certainly didn't entice her into her box. I suspect she had other issues for a while (it may be an age thing) that has made her box habits slip. Mostly now she's using it again (without using this product) - although she tends to favor one corner so much it's a bit of a problem, and sometimes over-shoots or just stops on the edge and wees outside of the box. We clean it regularly, at least once a day as a rule so whatever! I had hoped this might get her to be more drawn into the box and use it more evenly and more reliably but again- no effect whatsoever. $9 wasted. Probably end up composting it."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"A dual retractable leash is a great idea but this leash is NOT a great product.  In fact, it's not even a good product.  Within a few weeks, one of the leads had started freezing up in the retracted mode during our walks.  Since I walk my dogs 2 miles each night, that could be get really annoying by the time I carried the excess leash length for a half mile or so.  Then, it would slowly (and randomly) retract again for no apparent reason.  I kept using it hoping that the stiffness in the locking mechanism was responsible and it would loosen up.  No such luck.  It just continued to get worse.  The final straw was when one of my dogs got the retracted lead wrapped around her back legs and fell hard on the sidewalk.  I carried the leash while we slow-walked (she was still freaked out)for a mile to get home.  The leash is now hanging in the hallway with the retracted lead coiled up on the floor.  Bottom line:  don't waste your money."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"My cats loved this product. I used Instinct food for them prior to starting to make my own food two years ago. Originally, I had purchased the rabbit treats until one kitty developed a rash under his chin. Okay, switched to chicken. First cat's problem went away. Then a second cat developed LUMPS under her chin. Not a rash, lumps. Lumps were surgically removed, pathology done, results were; ""typical with an allergic reaction."" As the only other item that ever crosses their lips were these treats, the vet zeroed in on the treats as the culprit. (My food is made from chicken thighs, livers, gizzards and hearts, all human grade, from the human food case at the store.) In hindsight I should have known better after the first kittie's reaction...this has been a very expensive error on my part. The rest of my cats (there are 11) showed no outward reactions. They have consumed the treats on an off for for over a year. No idea if something in the product changed, or if my furchildren grew resistant to the product's ingredients. If you use this product, Keep a close watch on your kittie's chin!!"
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"The kabana does cover the litter box on all sides but I'm not impressed for the cost.  The instructions for assembly were not as clear as needed.  It is not sturdy.  Our cat took a leap on top of it ONCE (never again) and the top pole is noticeably bent.  Granted, it's not supposed to be jumped on; in hindsight, the cloth tent is not a good option for cats that are naturally going to jump on surfaces.  Also, the sides of the litterbox lid get stuck on the sides of the tent so opening the lid is not smooth.  The window at the back of the tent that is supposed to allow you to get to the buttons and settings is a joke.  Not only is it difficult to see what the settings are, but there's no way you can stick your hand into the tent AND see what you're doing at the same time.  It does allow the cord to be plugged but there's no other benefit to the window.  I haven't decided what we will try next but this purchase is a bust."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"I have two cats - one who was OBSESSED with these treats and another who turned his nose up at these.  My cat who ate these was a consistent vomiter, and I always assumed it was hairball related.  However,  I started to notice that after she ate these treats, she seemed to throw up more.... I researched online and found 100s of people who reported that these treats made their cats ill to the point of death in some cases.  I immediately threw my treats away and alerted all the cat parents I knew of the potential risk.  I couldn't imagine losing my fur child to something so senseless!

After tossing these, my cat has had no vomiting incidents and has done just find without treats.  My cat who never liked these has never had any issues getting sick, which leads me to believe that these were negatively affecting the health of my cat.  We've kept their food the same otherwise, so this was the only variable that has changed.  If you must give these to your cat, please proceed with caution and keep an eye on their health."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"This is the second and LAST time I will purchase these for my pet. The pieces in the bag did not look appetizing to begin with. Looked like the pieces had a lot of dark areas, like they were all from next to boned. It also seemed greasy when breaking into smaller pieces. Tried to feed these to my pet 2 different times, thinking maybe the first time she had eaten them too fast or something, but she promptly threw up her stomach contents both time. This happened earlier with a couple of bags purchased about 6 to 9 mos ago. I don't know what the issue is with this brand, it is supposed to have only 1 ingredient, chicken, in it. well it must be the crappiest, cheapest, most disease ridden chicken they can find. I purchase the Life Essentials brand by Cat Man Doo all the time --although they are for cats and come in much smaller bag-- these have NEVER EVER made my pet sick. NEVER!

Do not buy these. This is so upsetting to have my pet sickened in this way by something that is supposed to be a TREAT."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"This is impossible to keep clean.  I empty the water completely and refill daily, and I take the stupid thing apart and clean it thoroughly weekly, but it still gets slimy and icky.  Taking it apart and cleaning should be simple and straightforward.  They are not.  Even with sponges, bottle brushes and toothpicks, there are still crevices that stubbornly hold on to the goobies that end up in my cats water.  Taking the motor apart is a huge pain, and I didn't even know I was supposed to do that until I dropped the unit while cleaning, and the lever that is supposed to control the water flow (that, in fact, does nothing) broke off.  I looked inside the motor and found slimy cat hairs and a goobie the size of marbles stuck inside!  You shouldn't have to break something to figure out you need to clean it.  I had been scrubbing the motor's plastic grating with an old toothbrush, but that wasn't enough work I guess.

My cats love it, but I will never purchase another one. I'll find a bubbly fountain that provides safe and clean water to the cats without driving the humans crazy!"
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"this seemed like one of the more higher end dog food since it cost twice as much as the dog food I got the first time I got my shelter dog.. She's a terrier mix (my vet tells me terriers are picky with food? I'm not entirely sure being a first-time dog owner), so I'm trying out different dog food that she'll like.. I saw great rating on this dog food, so I tried giving it a go, but she barely eats any! She'll only eat about a quarter of a cup an entire day, and start eating the grass outside when I take her out... I fed her the indoor mini dog royal canin stuff before, and that one smelled much nicer like a can of tuna (which made her poop smell nicer) and she actually ate her portions when I gave that to her. I was just hoping if I was going to spend that much money on dog food, I might as well find her the best one for her, but this one is a total miss.

I might give another brand besides royal canin a try (since it's so expensive...), but I'm going to stay away from the taste of the wild..."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"It is very, very small. It's a great concept, but it does not work for large, active dogs. The Velcro will not hold up to roughhousing, and if you loose your tags, you're screwed. Some people suggested that you can leave the tags attached to the O-ring and just slip them in the pouch, but still, you run the risk of the pouch ripping away. I ended up putting this on my cat and putting his rabies tag in it since he is an outdoor/indoor cat. He doesn't wander off, but instead of having to go thru the hassle to send it back, I just decided to put it on him.

Back to looking for more solutions, and it sucks because I bought 2 brand new tags for my dog so I could put them in this pouch. I just didn't realize it was going to be so small. It's almost the size of two postage stamps laid top to bottom. My husband suggested I put the tags on a carabiner and then unclip it from her at night and when she is in the house so we don't have to listen to them jangle. Then I can just clip the carabiner back on her when she goes outside."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"I got my backpack, tried to put my 5lb chihuahua in it and it doesn't look anything like the pictures on the page. The sizes aren't accurate.  I wasn't able to tighten the hole small enough so that my dog wouldn't fall out. I did not feel like my dog was safe in this carrier. Also, the first time I used it, I zipped it up once and when I unzipped it THE ZIPPER FELL OFF. I tried to get a refund through Amazon but I had to go through this third party seller. It was a huge hassle. I had to send them pictures of the broken zipper and they had issues opening the picture file even though it was a picture I took on my smart phone and sent it to them directly in an email. They would not take a return or give me a full refund. They offered to refund $5 to my credit card to make up for the broken zipper. I told them that was not acceptable and then they stopped responding. Beware of this seller. The company does not stand behind their products. If I NOT could raye them less tham 1 star, I would. I DO NOT AT ALL RECOMMENDED!!!"
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"For the most part this thing works by catching food and water from spilling out from the bowls. There are a few annoyances with this feeder, however:

- The top light part and the bottom dark part are two separate pieces with no clips or latches. it simply sit's on top loosely and my 8 week old puppy has pushed it out from the bottom part a few times.

- There are no easy way to pick this tray up. If you grab the top part you'll simply lift it away from the bottom part. You'll have to use to hands or hold at an awkward angle to pick up both trays.

- The rubber feets are loose and not securely attached to the tray. One fell out at some point and now the tray wobbles when the puppy tries to eat.

- The last thing is the bowls are very light or it has no method to secure the bowls from moving around when the dog tries to eat or simply being lifted completely out of the hole.

These things hard to see from the listing and only discovered after using for a week. It still works fine besides those annoyances. Some pros are my puppy likes to bite the walls like a chew toy."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"While I like the idea of my dogs having better breath, this stuff isn't the solution. Pro-Sense has some good products - I'm using their hip and joint supplement for my 14 year old dogs with real success. However, this water additive is a failure here.

None of my dogs will drink the water with even a teaspoon of this added. I keep three huge water bowls through out the house at all times - 6 dogs tend to empty them all at least once a day and twice a day if it's hot. I did two bowls with this added and one plain water. Not one dog would touch the water with the rinse in it. All six went to the untainted water bowl - I had to refill it three times yesterday. This morning I just emptied and scrubbed the other two and refilled with plain water.np Two dogs went right to them.

My other issue here is the inclusion of sorbitol in the ingredients. Why on Earth does dog mouth wash need a chemical fake sweetener?? I won't eat or drink anything with that nasty stuff in it and I don't want my dogs having it either. Between the sorbitol and all 6 dogs avoiding this, it's not something I would ever recommend."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"Customer service/warranty from this company is non exsistant. I have the largest one of these bowls and the stem on the bottom broke which then would not allow the water to flow up through the machine thus defeating the purpose and rendering it trash. I called customer service and they refused to replace it and told me to buy a new dome (the whole part that holds the water) for $59! More than the whole machine! I was then forced to glue it. Like other reviews have said, the dome leaks also. If you flip it over (right side up) after filling it any where but over the bowl, you will get a huge mess. The power plug gets extremely hot which is a safety hazard. Where the water flows down the side at the top, there are slits under the gray ring which allow the water to roll down the dome...you cant get to those very easy for cleaning and they become black with mold fairly fast (pretty nasty). If you have hard water, forget it because it will never come clean. I was very very disappointed with this and even more with the companies lack of care in their product especially since I have owned older models for my cats in the past."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"Had this only for a couple of days, already the thermostat quit working, battery?  haven't looked to see if the battery can be purchased.  Used heater  in the turtle tank & for the past 2 mornings the water temp is way too cold for my turtle, had it set to 82 & the water temp read 68.  Not impressed with this purchase, but we didn't want to invest too much money in a turtle setup until we know he's going to survive.

Edit:  July 23, 2016
After leaving this review about defective heater, the seller offered to replace it, so 5 stars for service.  I have received the replacement but haven't tried it yet as my turtle is in a stock tank outside & its been 105 degrees for past couple of weeks, he/she hasn't needed supplemental heat for now.  I am still going to buy a good, reliable heater to use as daily main heater though, even if this one works.  Also want to mention I did not receive the floating thermometer with either of these heaters.

Edit:  August 6, 2016
I have been using the replacement heater for about a week.  This one does work, however cant comment on longevity.  Very satisfied with seller for prompt replacement of defective heater."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"I bought this dog door 8 months ago and am on my fourth collar (for two dogs).  They are fragile and not designed well.  I don't know why they have the battery indicator light as the light works well past when the battery has enough juice to power the door signal, as far as I can tell.  When you open the case, the button often falls right out.

If you have two dogs, both have to have the water-resistant transmitter or both the non, because they have different signal strengths so one dog will be opening the door from 10' away while one will have to be right in front of it.

To get around having the silly second collar on the dog, I use the flimsy nylon strap to tie the transmitter to their real collar.  I like the zip tie idea better.

In case HiTec Pet reads these, your web site stinks.  The flashing graphic is so annoying.  Click on FAQ and it takes you to a fence FAQ.  I wait a week for a response on a 'support ticket' email, or 20 mins. on hold on the phone.  The site says to use the MS-2A collar if you burn through collars, then there is apparently no such thing?  There is no page for collars/accessories for sale?"
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"The first fountain lasted less than 1 month. The cheap plastic part just broke off in my hand when I was cleaning the system for only the 3rd time. The cats, and I, were loving it up until then. After all, it was the prettiest fountain out there, plus it is mostly ceramic. My poor boy loved drinking from it! I had concerns because of all the bad reviews but was optimistic that I would have a good experience. I returned the first one to Petsmart, which is where I purchased it and decided to take a try on another one ... some of us take longer to learn than others! That one started leaking all over the floor after cleaning it for the first time when I had it for little more than 1 week. Yes, the nut on the bottom was tightened. Same experience a number of other reviewers wrote about. The water was no longer coming up through the top end of the fountain, instead started coming out the bottom. I was so disgusted I just through it in the box and drove it back to Petsmart. I will try one of the cheap ones now and see if it works. At least if it breaks, I won't feel like I got taken for a ride. I paid over $80 for this piece of garbage! LISTEN TO THE BAD REVIEWS!!!"
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"Normally I have good luck with my purchases. I generally do my research and buy well made products. I bought one of these units and used it successfully for six months. During that time it kept my tropical aquarium at a solid 78F.

One morning, I went to feed my fish and the water was much warmer than normal. I checked the thermometer and it read 90F, luckily my fish were all still alive. I turned the heater knob down to 70 and allowed the water to cool down on its own. After several hours it held 82. I hadn't done a water change in nearly a week so it's not that I let the water level drop.

No big deal, these things happen. Luckily these heaters have a lifetime warranty. I contacted Aqueon by email and received no response. I sent another one a week later, and no response. I couldn't find a phone number for them.

Look, sometimes heaters malfunction. A manufacturer can do all they can to prevent it and back it up with a guarantee. But if they don't stand by their own guarantee or even answer your emails, it isn't a crap product; it's a crap company.

If you are going to buy an Aqueon heater, I recommend the Aqueon Pro instead of this one. They are better units in my experience. Otherwise, have a look at the Eheim Jager, or Fluval offerings."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"I ordered this because I wanted something easier than the usual chicken carrot made from scratch cake that I usually make for the pup's birthday. It's definitely easy. Add the ingredients and stir. My oven was not working so I put it in a silicon bone shaped dish in the microwave for the 2 minutes it says on the box. The middle was still not cooked, I think I went all the way to 4 minutes and it still was not cooked in the middle, So I used a glass cot cut out the middle a little bigger than the uncooked part and put that back in the microwave for 1 minute and it finally got cooked. Put the middle back in and the dogs didn't mind at all. The icing was thin and the amount was small so I stretched it with some Greek yogurt, again, the dogs didn't mind. Since all this is silliness, it's up to you if you care about how it looks. The dogs when given permission eat every last crumb and they loved it. I might buy it again, this time I just had neck surgery and the oven was broke. Also I think it was the perfect size for my three golden retrievers - not too big so that I worried about how their stomachs would handle it, and everyone did fine there too."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"I put this on a large 6 month old kitten, who is already quite muscular, but with all the litheness of a kitty with especially slick, longish hair. I successfully put smaller versions on two smaller kittens, who did not have the strength to object quite so vigorously. This is another drawback of this rig. If the cat gets in in his head that he does not want this gizmo put on him, it becomes very difficult to attach it. Two grown men, both with good histories with wrangling cats, tried to put this rig on my 6 month old male, and it was quite a chore. There are two clips which fasten beneath the cat's tummy, which are so small, it becomes very difficult for a normal adult to open them. It is also difficult to connect the two halves, when they are laying against a cat with moderately long fur, which insists on getting in the way. These noisome connections are at the most inconvenient location, when a single person has to hold down an uncooperative kitty, and connect them at the same time. You need four hands at least.

So, that is two strikes against this design for large, energetic cats. After two grown men believed they had successfully harnessed our feline Houdini, he wriggled out of it in about 2 minutes. One second it was on, and the next, it was off. It was that fast. Makes me want to go into business to design a better kitty harness."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"I bought the PIF00 primary kit and the extra transmitter for my Shepard. I bought the extra transmitter due to the large yard.
The items (other than the test light) themselves appeared to be quality construction.
When I started putting out the flags, using the test light was hit or miss.  I'd plant a flag then move back and start heading outward again 10 to the side.  In some places the circumference was ok.  On others, it wasn't equidistant from the main unit (I started with the single main unit).  So, when the circle was done, I had a semi circle of flags with some at a different radius than others.  While that would have been ok - the dog would just have a non perfect circle...  However, when I went back to check again, the test light lit up at different radii than the original layout.  Basically, the dog might get zapped at a location today where he was fine yesterday.  Not something I'm willing to risk.
The test light has 2 thin wire contacts that started to bend and in my opinion would eventually break.  I had to wiggle the test light on the collar's contacts to make sure they touched.
Your mileage may vary if you buy and deploy this system.
The return process was smoother than I expected.  So hopefully if you try this product (great system and I may have received a bad test light) and it doesn't work, it's not $600 down the drain."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"I had considered one of these kinds of cat litter boxes for a long time but always figured my cats would probably not use it, especially after seeing it go through a sweeping cycle. I was very surprised how easily they took to it and immediately seemed to prefer it over their regular litter boxes. My only real criticism of the box is that it instructs you to use very little litter and it often times is not enough for the cat to cover and the rake leaves what little there is at the end of the box. I do think it will be a real help when we have to leave the cats unattended for a log period of time. The motor operates very quietly and it was easy to assemble.  I have two cats and since you are supposed to have 1 more litter box than cats I can see where having to buy 3 of these would get pretty expensive. However, price aside, I would recommend this for anyone wanting to cut back on a nasty job.
 1 month follow-up:
  This is a neat concept but there are such wide spaces on the rake that it leaves a lot of little pieces behind and the maximum recommended level of cat litter is hardly enough for the cat to cover it up. I also think the 15 minute delay is not long enough for it to dry up and become scoopable. After using it for nearly a month I withdraw my recommendation. The con's outweigh the pro's."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"Remember when Coca-Cola stupidly decided to mess with its formula and gave us ""New Coke,"" the soda no one in America had asked for? Well, the decision by Royal Canin to reformulate Indoor Light 40 gives me feelings of deja vu--why couldn't they just leave well enough alone? Whether that decision was driven by corporate bean counters looking to cut costs--as some here have suggested--I can't say. But the results, at least for my cat, have not been good.

My cat will eat ONLY dry food and, until a few weeks ago, the only brand I've ever fed him is Royal Canin, as recommended by his breeder. As time passed and he put on some weight, I moved to the Indoor Light 40 formula, which was fine... until Royal Canin decided to mess with the formula. His allergic reactions started almost immediately, though it took some consulting with my vet--and reading about similar experiences posted here--before I realized that the changed formula of his food was the cause.

I have now switched to Orijen dry cat food, which has vastly superior, high-protein meats and fish, and only 17% carbohydrates. He loves it, the allergy issues are gone and I feel better feeding him dry food that isn't laden with carbs. When it comes to cats, I can't say if my experience will be your experience. However, there seems to be no benefit to the reformulation of Indoor Light, but it has caused problems for many cat owners, including myself.

Thanks for taking the time to read my review, and I hope you find it helpful in making a buying decision."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"If you replace the pump with a Whisper 10 air pump or something more powerful than the pump that comes with the Whisper 3i filter, then you have a serviceable little, low profile filter. Puts out about 25 gallon per hour then. I coupled it with an Azoo Mignon 60 HOB compact power filter. I had several others where I also switched out the pump. (Use for airstone or sponge filter.).  Because I have a lip on one the tanks, I had to modify the attachment system.  I cut and shaped a length of plastic coated wire hanger into 2 S hooks. I coated the exposed metal ends with aquarium sealer. Then I drilled 2 holes, spaced 2 inches apart in the upper back of the filter housing.  Place the S hooks through the holes and hang of over the lip of your tank.  Be sure and measure for correct desired water level. Final touch. Put a suction cup on the lower stud of the filter back. Be sure to clean the area of the tank wall where the suction cup is to be placed. Stiff, coated auto or household electrical wire will also work for making the attachment hooks. Now the formerly deficient filters work great. They use a minute amount of space and now have more suction and outflow. Be sure to occasionally clean the hole where the airline meets the uptake tube. I enlarged mine. I also had one where a hole had not been drilled through. All the other Tetra Power filters, 10i and above are strong, long lasting, quality filters."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"Purchased this stroller September 2013 to help my beagle with a ligament issue in his back leg take a break on walks. At first I was happy with the quality of the stroller including the wheels (actual tires with inner tubes) and the ability to easily lock the stroller in place. It also gave us the freedom to go on longer walks. However as reported by another reviewer, despite the stroller saying ""up to 70 pounds"" this was completely inaccurate. As such, my dog would take up the entire stroller which put strain on some of the mesh panels which then began to unravel. Since the stroller did give us the freedom to move about I kept it and made repairs every time a section came undone though over time the separation in the fabric occurred all over the stroller and not just where he would lean. The stroller had major patchwork from all my repairs but I was going for function over looks. However, with continued use the frame became a quite wonky though still usable but the final nail in the coffin occurred today when one of the back tires broke off while we were using it. I'm going to research how much a spare tire would cost but frankly, after 2 1/2 years of intermittent use I expected it to last a  bit longer considering the price I paid at the time, $216 plus tax. If you have a small dog-less than 25 lbs, this stroller may work for you but if we decide to get another stroller I don't think I will go with this brand."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"I have to blame myself. I knew when I first looked at it after my girlfriend ordered it - not as secure as our existing harness. Dog can't slip out by pulling forward, but if he freaks out and spins and pulls backward, it could happen. I KNEW it could happen.

It did happen - in the middle of Hollywood.

He was freaked out by a noise, was spinning in circles, slipped out and ran away - ran around a huge block, me in futile pursuit (he runs like a greyhound,) crossed 2 busy streets twice (Yucca and Wilcox) and almost went to Hollywood Blvd. Somehow he survived and this story has a true Hollywood ending... apparently a taxi driver had just let out a fare and my little guy jumped in - only way he could've gone in was on his own. Driver waved me up the street, ""He's here!"" Pointed to his yellow mini-van/taxi. I thought he meant he was hiding underneath - no, he was locked in the back seat.

I had 2 large dogs for over a decade, always had them on either a choker or a secure harness, to avoid my greatest fear of them getting loose. Never happened, they both passed away recently within 6 months of each other. Found this little guy in between, almost lost him because of this harness. Yes - it was on snug. It's not a secure design. Look at it!

Thanks to that taxi driver, I now believe in miracles, but I have zero faith in this harness and am throwing it away when I get home - no matter what my girlfriend says."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"Well, it just came in the mail and I was so excited (my 7 months old adopted dog is a mad chewer, particularly on cords) that I opened it immediately and began to put it on my iPad cord. I carefully put it in and squeezed it shut to be sure no actual cord was exposed. It stunk like mad, but I figured that would die down and at least my cords weren't being destroyed - heck, if I had to I could charge it in another room, right? I had the 10 foot size open because it's a long cord, so only a small piece had to be trimmed. My fingers are reeking by now, and I'm about to eat lunch, but hey, the dog won't chew on it, right? I deliberately left the cord on the floor while I went to make my lunch, peeking in on the puppy. Stayed away completely, so I couldn't tell if it would deter. Went in to eat (or try to, it really smelled fresh out of the package) and the puppy was sitting off to the side, behaving himself, so...... WAIT! What's that. He's chewing on the small piece of cord protector I cut off. And as I watched to see if it bothered him at all, he continued to worry it and chew.
Maybe this stuff works on some dogs. I'm going to have to try the bitter Apple repellant spray I bought along with this and hope for the best. Sure wish I hadn't gotten 2 packs of each size though. With that smell, and the poor results, no way I'm using it."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"These bees are supposed to be replacements for the beehive toy, but these toys are great individually! Last year I bought my dog the chipmunks and the tree stump and wanted to get the chipmunks replacement this year, but they were $3 dollars more than these! If you watch the price it could go down to about $4.50. It's an awesome deal! Dog toys are expensive and these are made so well. My dog loves any thing with a squeaker and even though hes 14 pounds, he destroys every time I've given him except for these Kyjen chipmunk/bees etc. They're a great treat for dogs who love toys and they're economical since they last for a very long time! I definitely recommend them and I will buy them again as soon as they hit the four dollar mark ;)

edit jan 21st
sad to say, but I have to take down 2 star... these toys are awesome little things that my dog loves to throw in the air and catch, but the squeakers inside are horrible! The squeakers inside last about an hour, but they never squeak again... they're very poorly made. The squeaker inside has two parts and the little thing that makes the squeaker squeak always slides out. Then the squeaker part always gets smashed within an hour that my dog gets bored of it. That's the only problem with this toy which is kind of a big deal since the whole point is for it to squeak! Anyways they are very durable and if you just replace the squeaker, your dog will be able to enjoy this toy for a very long time :)"
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"Purchased this light for my high-tech planted tank before really doing much research. After using the light for a few weeks I've come to realize that it's not enough light for ""high-light"" plants. This model only puts out 20W which means that for a 20g tank you're still only getting 1W/gallon. CurrentUSA also claims a PAR reading of 100 in the center from 12"" above. Every single third-party test I've seen and read refutes this claim. The most I've seen from independent tests is about 65-70 PAR in ideal conditions. Not bad, but definitely not an honest description by CurrentUSA.

One other thing I really dislike about this light is the controller (the brains of the hardware). I really wish they would have integrated the controller into the housing unit of the light because it seems to always fall off my table and whenever I pick it up the buttons are so sensitive that one slight touch the lights will come on full blast in the middle of the night and startle my fish. The 24/7 feature is kind of nice and so is the dawn/dusk feature. I could have done without the gimmicky settings such as cloudy and lightning storm.

At the end of the day I ended up buying two units in order to get the PAR values that I needed for my tank. If you decide to do something similar just keep in mind that you cannot pair two units with one controller however you can use the same remote to control the two separate controllers. Overall  if you are looking for a low to mid light for around $100 (not sure why anyone would) then you may want to consider this light."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"I just received this item today. At first glance, it looks attractive enough. Upon closer inspection, it is a poorly made item. The manufacturers should have put more thought in quality rather than adding two decorative silver bones which adds no function to this item. The stitching is unraveling at the ""leash area."" The ""tag"" stitching also has unraveled. If I were the cynical type, I would say that the supplier knew of the unraveled stitching and tried to glue it back together but it didn't hold. Also the hidden tag is paper under a plastic sleeve. I would never trust my beloved dog to only have this as a tag. It is not waterproof nor is it secure in it's sleeve; The tag is useless. The ""D"" is too bulky, and as others have mention, the extra collar end just hangs there, making the collar look unfinished and shabby. The built-in leash is a great idea, but this item falls short in quality. The leash is made of some stretching rubber (kind of like a car fan belt but not as strong). I predict that this leash will break if used too often, so I am not going to rely on it in public. I'll just use it in the house. I normally would return a product like this but it probably would cost me more in time and money to ship it back, which is probably what the supplier counts on. Buyers, read the reviews carefully, cause the reviews I read were right on. I'll use it for six months, which it what I give it before it's none usable. For now I will keep looking for a similar product but with better workmanship. Fail."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"I feed two indoor fairly picky cats, and a colony of about five outdoor non-picky cats.  So I have a built in team ready to help me test cat food!  I was eager to try this dry food.  It's always good to read on the bag about the caring people that put together foods for our feline friends, and this one looked well thought out and full of interesting and nutritious ingredients (although I always do wonder if cats really need cranberries or sweet potatoes or the like, but they are used to take the place of grains, which I am sure cats don't need).

Well, my feline crew did not care much for the food.  The indoor cats did eat it eagerly for the first few bites---they must have liked the smell or the look---but after that, they shunned it.  They would not eat it at all, and in fact found things around the house to put on top of the plates of it---something they do to bury food they really don't care for.  The outdoor cats were not much more of fans.  They ate a bit of it, and then looked at me with annoyance, wanting their usual cans.  I left the dry food down, and later in the day they did eat a small amount, but most of it was left by the end of the day, which is quite unusual.

So---no matter how well made and well meaning a cat food is, if your cats won't eat it, it's not really worth it.  I can't say what it is they didn't like---I wish I could get that information from them!  Perhaps you have less picky cats---lucky you!"
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"I am a first time owner. I read that it is best to feed a puppy higher quality foods instead of the big commercial brands.  After reading a lot of positive reviews, I decided to try Wellness Super5 for Puppies. Worst mistake I ever made.  My little bully's stool was never firm.  It did however make his coat very shiny. But he developed a very bad case of diarrhea. He stopped eating and drinking for a day.  I was so worried about the lil guy. After an overnight stay (& a very expensive vet bill), my lil bully returned home full of energy.  The vet recommened that he would have to eat canned Purina EN for the rest of his life.  Realizing that they really just wanted my money, I decided to switch his food.  I decided to go with Canadae ALS. During the transition, BlackJack was still having a loose stool. After more research, I finally decided on Cal Natural Lamb & Rice. I started mixing this food and BJ developed a very bad bloody diarrhea case.  I started the ""at home remedy"" of pepto bismol and a bland diet.  The pet store clerk recommended some canned pumpkin as well.  BJ fasted for 24 hours.  After feeding him boiled chicken & rice for a few days, the blood gradually disappeared. I slowly started mixing the Cal Natural Lamb & Rice. All i can say is BJ is feeling 100% better and his stool is solid!!!  This was the result I wanted with Wellness, but I was very disappointed.

IF YOU WANT A HEALTHY PET AND A FEW BUCKS SAVED FROM A VET VISIT, PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM THIS FOOD!"
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"We were feeding this to our two puppies (Goldens) for the past 7 months. At first they seemed to like it okay and then all of the sudden the last bag of food they weren't interested in it at all. Matter of fact, as hungry as they were, they would leave their entire bowl of food, untouched all day long. Only at night would they eat a TINY tad, only enough to basically sustain life out of starvation. One of the puppies started looking thinner and mind you, these ""puppies"" are already between 60-65 pounds each so I know they had be hungry. I started doing my own research on the food to try to see if others were experiencing this behavior with their dogs also. While I hadn't been buying this food on Amazon, I was buying it at our local pet food store, I still feel compelled to let everyone know that consumer affairs has a lot of complaints about this food, with the same exact symptoms as a lot of people on Amazon have and the same as we had with our two puppies, refusing to eat and loose stools. I returned the last bag I had purchased from the pet food store today and replaced their food with ""Zignature"" limited ingredient dog food and let me tell you, these dogs tore it up!! As soon as I sat their bowls down they started gobbling their food up. No I am not an employee of Zignature or paid by the company, this is just my honest review. So if your dog's refusing to eat or only nibbling at their bowl of TOTW and have loose stool or diarrhea, you may want to think about changing foods. Look up the consumer complaints yourself."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"I am very disappointed in this product.  And, I'm disappointed in myself for not calling Dremel within the first year of getting it and complaining.
First I'll describe my disappointment when it RAN:
--  its heavy
--  its noisy - scares both my dogs.  The less ""sophisticated"" pedi-paw is easier to use and not as noisy.
-- battery charge didn't last long.
Second, when it didn't run:
-- I'd plug it into the charger and into the wall.  It appeared to charge, but upon using it, within minutes it would lose power again.

In the 3 years since I originally purchased this product on Amazon, I have used it only a few times.  I just recently saw it in the ""dog grooming box"" and thought, ""Hey, let me try this again, before I throw it out"".  Plug it into charger and into the wall, and nothing.  No light, nada.

So I call Dremel Customer service and explain the general problem I've had with this product since the beginning and asked if based on these symptoms, it is the charger, the battery or both?

The answer was disappointing too.  No idea.  You'd think there would be some experience with this set of problems.
The cost of replacing both the charger and the battery is more than buying a new one at Walmart.
She did suggest sending it into Dremel and explaining and maybe they would do something about it.
I considered that, but spending another $5 or so on shipping for a product that really wasn't very good in the first place is just not worth it.

Maybe the product I received was a lemon compared to all the other great reviews out there.  But still, I found it way too noisy to be useful on an animal.

Dang, hate wasting money."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"I have an anxious dog.  His anxiety is not such that my Veterinarian has recommended ""serious"" drugs for management, but I do like to try out the over-the-counter offerings like this one with him.

The big downside of this nutraceutical is palatability... neither of my dogs liked the taste and would ""eat around it"" when it was in their food.  I could easily ""pill"" them with it, but that's a hassle and I don't think it's particularly helpful to force things on an already anxious dog.  They would not eat it even when it was combined with peanut butter or had cheese wrapped around.  They are, admittedly, kind of picky, but that made this product unsuitable for us.

The ingredients are
Active Ingredients (Per Tablet)
Chamomile - 150mg
Passionflower Powder - 100mg
GABA (Gamma Amino Butyric Acid) - 100mg
L-Theanine - 50mg
L-Tryptophan - 33mg
Thiamine (Mononitrate) - 4mg
Ginger Root Powder - 2.5mg
Inactive Ingredients Beef flavor, brewers yeast powder, liver powder, magnesium stearate, cellulose, silicon dioxide, stearic acid, thiamine mononitrate.

These are interesting and not ones I have seen combined before.  Theoretically, the L-tryptophan and L-theanine, in particular, could have calming effects, although the research jury is still out on everything from dose to actual efficacy.  I do think this comes under the heading of ""mostly harmless,"" although you should always check with your Vet about anything with which you plan to attempt to treat your pet long term.

This is certainly affordable, compared to a few of the other popular over-the-counter remedies.  Be aware that it is very common for it to take 6 weeks or longer before you see effects from any nutraceutical.  Cautions on this product indicate that it hasn't been proven safe for pregnant or lactating bitches, and that it should be discontinued 5 days before any general anesthesia is administered."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"I got this in the August Blockhead Box (a dog subscription box).  I have the ""large"" version and, for the record, my dog is an 83-84 pound Rottweiler who is super destructive.

This lasted my dog longer than a lot of cloth-covered toys (I hesitate to call it ""plush"" because it's not particularly soft and doesn't have stuffing).  As in, like five minutes.  Part of the reason was she had a bit of trouble picking it up, but I'm not blaming that on the toy, I'm blaming it on my dog.  She kept trying to pick it up by the middle, while one of her feet was holding the outside part down...anyway, she did eventually get it up.

My dog has the uncanny ability to find the weak point in any toy.  In this case, it is the embroidered KONG logo.  She started gnawing on that after a few minutes and I did eventually have to take it away because she put a few small holes in it near the logo.  For what it's worth, she did LOVE this toy and was sad to have it taken away, and it held up pretty well to tugging.  Also, although there are squeakers, she really didn't squeak this too much (for once, much to my relief...).

In the end, maybe this is not for the heaviest of chewers, but I have no doubt it would work for some dogs (like my last Rottie, who was very gentle with toys).  The large is appropriate for large breed dogs.  Although my dog is on the small side for a Rottie, I would feel comfortable giving this to a dog 20 or 30 pounds heavier, as well.  I would definitely supervise at first, especially if you know your dog is destructive."

We raise Goldendoodles, and I had HIGH hopes that my puppies would love this as I've been researching high quality dog foods.... well it doesn't matter how high the quality is supposed to be if the puppies/dogs won't eat it! NONE of my 5 adult dogs or 12 puppies ages 2-8 month old puppies would eat it straight. I've been having to mix in meat drippings to get them to eat any of it and it caused SEVERE digestive upsets in ALL my dogs! Also when I bought mine (it was on sale) I told my daughter to try it for her dog & she had the same problem, she was mixing it 50/50 with his regular food and where he normally ate 1 bowl a day, his bowl sat for 3 days and still had kibble in it and he also had an upset stomach from the little he ate and she was up cleaning his ""accidents"" and this dog that had never had one, had several in the middle  of the night !! If this was any good (*& my dogs liked it) I was going to order 20 bags at the sale price of 2/3 off! But now I know why it was so heavily discounted. The dogs won't eat it and it makes them sick!

Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"When the price lowered, I snatched this up. I just received it and am furious with FedEx because they left it out in the snow and when I went to lift it, the bottom fell open. Amazon did not pkg very well. FedEx just sucks...

Anyway, I am currently sitting amongst the parts of this thing trying to figure how the heck to put it together bc these are the worst instructions I've ever seen!! And I put together a much larger cat tree earlier this year.

For example, the instructions simply tell you you should have 8 lg sisal posts. What they don't decipher is that there are actually 6 of one size and two slightly smaller ones. And of the larger ones, several are weighted. It doesn't tell you which to use where. I'm going to assume the heavily weighted ones go on the bottom...

The pics in the instructions are also horrible. They are blurry and unclear. Still trying to figure out which is a base. I'm just going to look at a full color pic and wing it.

Update: I got it ""put together."" It's in quotes because I think the one piece is broken because it won't stay connected. And parts are missing from the catnip toy station. Very frustrating... There are two 'catnip stations' which are basically a hanging fuzzy ball surrounded by plastic tubes so it looks like a little cage. I am missing six of those tubes so I can't put the other catnip station on. Which means there is no stabilization there. And even the one I did add... as soon as the cats touch it, it will just pop off. Nothing really keeps it together!

And I think there need to be more longer screws. They expect you to use the shorter screws in parts where it doesn't work. I am sorry I bothered with this one. Mistake..."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"So, I wanted to remove an item from my tank. First, I should say, I have a 25G aquarium with a Cascade 700 filter. Which is a canister filter for aquariums up to 65G. Obviously I'm over filtering and it creates a strong current, which I like because I primarily do a planted tank.

Pros;
1) It kept my tank at a very stable 82 degrees. I kept it high on purpose as I breed German Blue Rams. It was fabulous, and I temp gauge always seemed to be working. It turned on/off appropriately.
I really like this stability because it can be harder to get it with glass/titanium heaters that are inside the aquarium.

2) Another item out of the tank! Seriously, it was so nice not having a heater in the tank.

Cons;
1) The main reason I'm sending this back is that it extremely and negatively impacted the water flow rate. In the instructions it says to put it on the outfilter tube -- and I did, but because this device has to be VERTICAL to avoid air bubbles getting trapped, rising to surface, and damaging it-- I had to have a lot of extra tubing. This significant drop in outflow made it impossible for it to properly aerate my water, and it also allowed for algae spores to settle.

Now, a solution to this would be ideally to put it into the infilter tube instead.  However, because I have a planted tank I ultimately decided against this. I didn't want to to deal with lots of gunk getting in the heater pipe. =/ I mean, that's the idea essentially to putting it on infilter over outfilter. It would be easy enough to clean out, but I looked at it as another frustration.

So, because of the cons, I ended up returning it. I mean, even with a circulation pump in my aquarium, I hated that the filter had been impacted so dramatically."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"The prduct description for these toys says they are ""ecologically responsible"".  I personally don't think killing animals for leather is an ecologically responsible action.  If you love your pets enough to buy them lots of nice toys, then you're an animal lover like myself.  If you love animals as much as I do, then you're probably a vegetarian and don't use animal products like leather.  When I purchased these cat toys I was not aware that they were made with leather because the product description omits this detail.  As soon as I opened the box from Amazon and saw the genuine leather fish heads I was absolutely furious!  Why on earth would I want one animal to suffer - a cow used for its hide - so that I can provide a play toy for another animal - my cat?  I would never kill a cat to use its hide to make a toy for a cow!!

I did end up keeping the toys because I didn't want to deal with returning them - which would also be ecologically irresponsible with the resources going in to the shipping process.  Also, one of my cats absolutely loves feather toys which was the main reason I purchased these in the first place, so I gave him the fishies and he loves them.  They aren't the most popular toys in the kitty basket, but they haven't gone unused.  If my cats are really hyper and I toss the fishies in the air for them they will go after them, but if the toys are just laying there the cats don't go up to them and start playing with them.

I would not recommend these toys to a friend and I would not purchase them again.  If, however, the materials were changed to a faux leather or other man-made material, I would be happy to give a better review/rating."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"These made my dog sick. The other night she was vomiting all night long and had terrible diarrhea. The poor girl was so nauseated that she was dry heaving after completely emptying her stomach. It went on and on for hours. She basically was suffering the same symptoms that humans do when they have a very bad case of food poisoning, complete with chills and shivering, very sore abdominal muscles, weakness and dehydration. It was just awful for her. In the morning, of course, we rushed her to the vet. That was Saturday morning and now it's the wee hours of Monday (I can't sleep) and she's still at the animal hospital having IV fluids, anti-emetics and antibiotics. The vet hopes she can come home later today, but it might not be until tomorrow. The ONLY thing my dogs ate that was new and different in the last several days were these T-Bonz. They each got 2 as a treat. I didn't think the treats had anything to do with it until my other dog had diarrhea and threw-up a bit that morning before we went to the vet. Thankfully he only vomited once and only had a bit of diarrhea and soft stools a couple of times. My pup that got sick had a splenectomy last year, so I'm thinking that whatever was in these treats that made them sick, her body just had a much harder time fighting it off than his. I strongly recommend you NOT give your dog these treats unless you're willing to risk a hefty vet bill, a very sick and completely miserable dog, along with a miserable family, themselves all sick with worry. (Also, just in case it helps anyone or helps add some perspective and clarity: my dog that got very sick is a 20lb schnauzer female, 10 years-old. The dog with a bit stronger stomach is a cocker spaniel-mix male that's 37lbs and he's roughly 10 years-old, give-or-take a couple of years."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"Purchased this for my adopted puppy. He was 10 months old, and over 90lbs when we got him. He came from a neglectful home, had never walked on a leash and was not trained at all. He pulls a lot on the leash, and is a jumper. A regular collar and leash was not cutting it. The only attention he got at home before was when he jumped up on his owners, which he did to us, then got him over excited and he began to mouth and nip. At almost 100lbs, this normal puppy behavior did a lot of damage.
This product is well constructed, and good quality. It comes with an instructional DVD as well. However, I followed the DVD, and eased him into sizing and wearing this, gave him lots of love and treats during the whole process. He seemed fine with it and I tried having him wear it for a couple seconds at a time and went from there. He didn't seem to have a problem wearing it. However, when it came to actually using with a leash, my dog simply would not have it. He would struggle and/or flop to the floor and not move, and he always found a way out of the nose piece, even though it fit the way the video said it should. My dog is very stubborn and the most I could ever get him to walk on this was one lap around the living room. I wish this had worked for us, but it just wasn't a good fit for us. We bought the ""Easy Walk Dog Harness"" by the same brand at the same time, thinking we'd start with this one and work our way up to just the regular harness. It didn't work out that way, but the easy walk hardness was a much better fit. Don't give up too quickly if you have a difficult dog, or are an inexperienced dog owner like I am."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,I decided to purchase a newer canister type filter.  The reason for this is my 54 gallon tank had been shut down for 3 months with only the dried up gravel in it.  So I started it back up in October of 2014 with my Magnum 350.  I decided to test my tank for ph and ammonia levels and found out that the ammonia was 1.0 ppm too high.  Of course I immediately dosed the tank with Ammo Lock.  Other then that the tank was doing well with no fish in it as of yet.  Because of the ammonia I went to my local pet store supplier and purchase the Aqua top CF400UV.  Installed it and within 24 hours the tank started to cloud up.  I made several water changes and cleaned the filter several times over a period of 2 weeks to no avail.  I contacted my local supplier and they replaced it thinking it must have been defective.  Well! The tank never cleared even after another 10 days of water changes and filter changes.  So I thought I would reinstall my Magnum 350.  Within 12 hours my tank was nearly clear.  After 24 hours it was crystal clear.  So I guess I have to say that I either got two defective filters or the Aqua top 400 UV just could not handle my water condition.  I have over 30 years experience with fish and tanks and I am baffled by this.  I found the filter easy to use and to be very quiet.  Just as an FYI for others who are new to this non self priming filter.  You should fill the canister first about 1 from the top and install the cover then fill the in and out inlets.  Hook it up and just press the primmer button twice or more and just turn it on and you are good to go.
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"Everlasting Fun Treat Ball / B0009YD8NS

I have several treat dispensing toys for my puppy, and I like this one the least. The design is very poor, in my opinion, at least compared to other treat toys we've used. To begin with, it is difficult to ""load"" the toy with food and treats because there are two identical loading holes, one opposite the other. This means that when I pour treats in, they pour right out on the opposite side. It's like filling a bucket with no bottom, and it's very frustrating. Eventually, you have to just find the biggest treats you can, and jam them in, which is a pain and a half. Not to mention the edges of the hole catch and grab at your fingers - fun!

That brings me to my next point - you cannot put small treats or puppy kibble in here as they will fall out immediately. Only big fat treats will provide the dog a challenge, but fortunately the makers of this product make such treats and are more than willing to sell them to you. Which is fine, I guess, and I went ahead and bought some, but I prefer to fill my treat toys with at least some regular kibble so that the puppy doesn't just gorge himself on a bunch of rich treats all at once. Since this ball won't allow me to do this, it's now an occasional toy, not a reliable daily toy. Bottom line: I feel that this toy is difficult to fill, and can only be used for ""treat gorging"" and not for regular dinner time. If your fingers are less delicate than mine and you just want a treat ball, you may like this - my dog certainly likes the chewy rubber and he hasn't destroyed it yet (although he's not much of a chewer). However, if you want an easy to fill ball that can hold kibble and enliven dinner time, I recommend the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Omega-Paw-Tricky-Treat-Ball/dp/B0002DK26M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Omega Paw Tricky Treat Ball</a>."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"I'm a perfectionist, in all I do and in my work; I expect the same pride in workmanship and design as I put into my own designs and products...

This cheap, thin, tin-like metal has no substance to it at all; its tantamount to a polished tin can. The 'anti spill' ring (atop the bowl) is too large for small breeds such as my 20 pound Shih-Tzu.  It arrived with the rubber, anti-slide/anti-skid, gasket detached, it falls off very easily and is nearly impossible to replace without stretching it, which totally defeats its purpose, in that it falls off almost every time you pick it up.

There is a hollow space under the anti spill, upper rim, that is impossible to keep clean.  Having no instructions, enclosed, who could possibly know that upper anti spill rim is designed to come off?  Good luck managing that feat and be careful not to pinch your skin both wrestling it off and getting it back on.  Having shopped finer boating and camping stores, I found this is a really bad knock off of the ones I have found since.

My really good dog food bowls are stainless steel, incredibly heavy and have lasted 3 lifetimes (dog lives) they cost a small fortune when I bought them 20 years ago, but were more than worth it.  I was looking for comparable water bowls when giving this a try; and it is not even close to being close.

Unless you only need this for the boat or camper for a week or two and a few weekends a year...  Do yourself a favor and buy heavy duty, stainless steel and don't have names put on (unless removable).  Spend the money once and never again.  My twenty year old bowls look brand new, even after 20 years of dishwasher abuse.  Whereas, my week old Indipets bowl is ALREADY scratched, falling apart and has pinched my finger so hard I still have a huge blood blister on my finger.."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"My dogs are fairly rough on toys - very few last for more than a week, and many die within a day or two. Obviously I am not alone in this: anyone reading this review is likely looking for a solid, durable toy which will survive the rough play of a chewer or large breed dog (or both).

This ball is not solid, and it is not durable.

The ball looks exactly like the 4.5"" model of a ""Soft & Tough Clutch"" ball I purchased last year. The cyan colored 6"" Soft & Tough Clutch that I purchased is easily my dogs' favorite toy, and has survived for many months now (I think I bought it in November) with nary a scratch. I decided to purchase a second ball because they loved it so much, and I went for the 4.5"" grape ball the next time around.

I took it out of the package and I could immediately feel the difference in the texture. I can't quite explain it, but the Soft & Tough feels exactly how its name describes it. This ball felt soft and rubbery, like the cheap $3-$5 Walmart toys I used to buy before I realized that they only lasted 10 minutes. The difference: this ball didn't even make it 10 minutes.

In less than 3 minutes, my dogs had begun taking chunks off of the ball and it had to go to the trash can. Put another way: prorated out, I was paying about $180/hour for this dog toy!!!

Bottom line: I am not sure if I got an imitation/knock-off, or if the balls are made by different companies. They look the same and are advertised the same on Amazon, but there was a clear and discernible difference in texture between the two balls, and that translated into the difference between a long-time favorite toy, and a 3-minute pile of garbage.

So buyer beware: the ""Soft & Clutch"" line earns 5 stars and then some, while the Soft-Flex ball is solidly in the ""don't waste your money on this"" category."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"I actually ordered the Litter Genie by mistake and let it sit for months. Now that I am using it I find the whole process annoying. This review should focus on the refills. It would be so much better if they came pre-sized with strongly sealed bottoms, perforated to separate and start a new one so all we have to do is push the refill down into the chamber. The whole size guessing, having to try to balloon out the plastic in the bottom to guess what length to cut then tie a secure knot in the bottom and hope you have performed all steps well enough so no blow-outs upon removal is vexing. The built in cutter works smoothly so scissors aren't needed. I am refraining from commenting on the entire device but can't separate  the two that easily. It might be better if the refills were better designed. I have a large cat with large urine clumps. They don't fit in the scoop and are ~too large to dump in the top. I use hard clumping scoopable litter. I wonder how messy it must be with old-fashioned clay, pine pellets or other media? I get tired of used litter scattering about during transfer, on the floor, the handles, the lip of the entrance and such.
I plan to use up the refills and donate this thing because my old large efficient sturdy scoop+ brown paper lunch bags collected into repurposed bags works better and is cheaper.
How about odor? I haven't quizzed friends but should. I am concerned because my cat has stopped defecating in his box since this was added and it is the ONLY change. Is it odor or something else that is distressing him? 40+ yrs as a cat owner and veterinary professional has me looking at all issues. Please no comments in cat litter box behavior...I've spent my life helping others. I just wonder if he hates this whole contraption as much as I do?
It has not made litter disposal simpler, easier, cleaner or cheaper."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"I am a full time dog trainer and I ordered this pouch in June. I wore this for 40 hours a week so I have to give some credit there, it held up pretty well for the amount of use. However, almost immediately the metal ring that stopped the cinch came out of the side of the bag and started to fray the material. I also did not have very good luck with the two sewn on straps next to the metal clip. They came out within the first month of me wearing the pouch. I had to use the cinch fairly often because dogs would find the pouch and stick their snoot in while I was talking to the owners, so I would cinch it closed. I finally ordered a new pouch in November (Doggone Good), so it took 6 months before I couldn't wear it any longer.

However, I did enjoy several features of the pouch which it seems my new pouch does not have. I could fit my iPhone 6 in the front zipper pocket easily so I could pull it out when I needed to make appointments or phone calls. As a woman, my pockets are very small so I am not sure where I am going to put my phone now. I also love the waste bag dispenser. I wholesaled ordered a bunch of waste bags so I was able to keep 3-5 rolls on me at a time, I never ran out. My new pouch only has room for two rolls. The metal clip on the back, even though I did not have the sewn straps, was very convenient and I could clip and unclip it from my belt very easily. I also liked that I could slip little things into the front mesh pocket, like prong collar links. So the bag isn't awful for the average dog owner, but won't withstand professional use.

I have included some pics so you can see how it looked the day I replaced it. The cinch area was in pretty rough shape at this point."
Pet_Supplies_5,negative,truthful,"The usual problem with reviewing cat toys is what to say when kitty doesn't like / use the toy. It's hard to evaluate a product made for cats as a human, so normally if I get a toy and Ms Cat does not like it, I say no harm, no foul and usually opine that someone else's cat may like the toy / furniture.

Not the case here. The entire premise of this toy is flawed, and I really don't think many cat owners or their pets will have much use for it.

First, the cat shown in the picture lounging on the arch of the X must have been a) very much smaller than normal cats and b) carefully trained. My own quadruped is very average sized and she could not at all lounge on this thing without drooping more than a third of her body off of it. Most cats will not willingly assume such a position, so don't think of this as furniture.

As a scratching post (and also as a theoretical lounging platform) this is also flawed, as it is very light weight and cheaply made. Cats will not use scratching posts that move around as they try to dig in, and this design is too light weight to offer the stability that a cat seeking to scratch is looking for.

My cat tried this once as a scratching post, after I poured catnip over it, and after it slid across the floor as she tried to stretch out, she turned her nose up at it and has not returned to it since.

Folks, if you want a scratching post, make sure it is solid and heavy. It will cost more than this does. If you want cat furniture, make sure it is solid and large enough to accommodate your cat. The designers of this product ignored these axioms and used a trained miniature cat to make it look more useful than it is.

Two stars, because your cat might like it as a scratching post if you can wedge it somewhere where it can't move around too easily."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"I short quick read. Nothing spectacular, but a good a story."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,Little more than a short story but interesting just the same.
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"Clean, short, easy read.  The writing style could use some improvement."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,Was Dee Henderson the author? far from her excellent O'Malley type style.
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,Too many too tedious stories. I got bored after a while with endless convolutions.
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,I'm afraid I didn't finish reading it. It was mostly information I already knew.
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,This was an okay read for a short story.  I did enjoy the suspense.
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,Not for me.  Not a fan of this type of relationship. Could not finish.
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,Christian scifi but a very different read. Its just a bit too far out for me.
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,I kept waiting for it to get better and gave up after the half way mark
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"it has been awhile since I've read this it was ok, but I will not reread."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"Hard to rate all the stories together. There were a couple that were excellent, some just 'meh'"
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,It's like all the rest a slow read but it gets better at the end then it's over
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"Disappointed!!! Everything happened just as expected - no twists or turns or unexpected plots.
Not an Amish story at all!!!"
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,I have read all the books in this series. This one is not up to the rest. It lacked something.
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"I enjoyed.  However, found the female role perplexing along with the dumbing down of the males. Worth a read."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"Compared to the first one, this was okay. There is a lot more sex and it is much more graphic."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"I just found this to be confusing and didn't understand the whys, hows, and all around point to this book."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"Truly something different.....and so erotic! Trey is by far a gem, and a very wise man! Nicety keep them coming..."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"""trail"" used instead of ""trial"" several times. Afford should have been affordable in that context. It could have been longer."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,It was a good build up of characters and a good plot but no sex occurred and it just ended
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,Very mediocre - nothing really new or interesting - two stories - no plot - some people might like it.
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"Quick read. Worth the download, but glad it was free. Really nothing special here, but nothing particularly wrong with it, either."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,Enjoyed parts of the book but needs to have better editing and your characters needed better development. Hence the three stars.
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,I started to really get into this book but it was to short and by far had the worst ending possible
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,Quick read. I thought the transformation of the h to be overly remarkable. I enjoyed the references to the condor/spirit guide.
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,Inspiring but sad how much human dysfunction affects the lives of our pets. I wanted to take him home with me.
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"It took a while before I got into the story, then I ended up liking it. Good fast read for anyone"
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"L'Amour is my favorite when it comes to western stories,but these didn't seem like they were up to his usual standards."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,I had hoped this book would have been better than the first. It was a LITTLE BIT better but not much!
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"Not bad, but could easily have been developed into a longer book. Just finishing the incomplete sentences would have lengthened the story!"
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,As with the preceding books in the series there where some scenes that were not very friendly. Definitely not a children's book..
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,I really tried but just couldn't get into it. It wasn't my style of writing. I am sure others will like though.
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"a good book, interesting story, kept my interest.  nothing exceptional, just a good, solid read.  I would recommend this book"
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,Delete it quickly and save yourself the time wasted even overusing this really bad romance novel.  proves anyone can write trash
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,The first two books were great....book three....not so much....it was pretty slow...with almost no tension. I would have left it at two.
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,Story line was easy to follow. Plot was good.characters  we're good.  Should have been longer. Recommend to others to read.
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,It's interesting but not sure how truthful it is & a lot of facts & dates wrong!! Not worth that much money!!
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"The author tried to make the mystery/romance novel cute, but I could not really get into the book. Would not really recommend."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,This was just okay.  Totally unrealistic but entertaining.  It was free so I am not complaining. The cover was enticing.
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,It was difficult keeping up with the two law enforcement agencies and plots.  And the ending left the most important question unanswered.
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,Who in their right mind would ever try to fit a pool ball in their mouth?? But i like how the stories connect.
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"I Was looking for some free games to play.  I don't like it, it's more of a waste of time, than anything."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"Really cute book. Wish it would have a little more to the ending, maybe take it through the wedding and the sister's reaction."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,Surprised at the level of humor written into the story. Enjoyed it and will look for more of her books in the future
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"What kinda ending was that? Wasn't really feeling this book, it took me forever to finish, when I usually read 2 a day."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,GO TO  PLAY STORE TYPE IN  PSTEC  8 MIN TO GET RID OF A BAD MEMORIE  YOU WONT BELIEVE IT
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"Nice twists, but too much focus on piggy over eating.  The characters are well developed otherwise.  Enjoyable book for a rainy day."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,In away I did like the story but it was just a little to short for my liking but the story line was good
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"Instantly hot, the plot draws you in and learn something new in every line. Well written, and very satisfying. Cannot wait for part two."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,THIS IS ONLY A FEW CHAPTERS OF A BOOK.  VERY DISAPPOINTED!  I thought it was a whole story!  Don't buy it.
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,She was one badass woman but argued about killing the guard. Come on!!! She was supposed to take over the company? Poor storytelling IMO!
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"Nice read, good characters, sweet love story.  Enjoyed reading the conclusion to the trilogy.  The touch of suspense added to its appeal."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"Characters not developed,poor grammar and punctuation, and a waste of time and money. Should be given away and not put up for purchase until developed."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,I absolutely loved this book it was such an amazing story my only reason for 3 stars is bc I wanted more of the ending
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"The plot was good, but characters not so good. This book was not a page turner...but at the same time would recommend for bored readers."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,Not as good and the others. was anticipating the final book when this came out. I sure hope the next book is not like this one.
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,This was the stupidest short story I've ever read. It's like the author just started writing every idea and rambled about it while making sex scenes.
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,I really wanted to like this book because I love old photographs and the concept of time travel but It just didn't deliver what I hoped..
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"These stories are short, but they could do more even with their limited pages. One sex scene? A rushed climax of confrontation? We can do better."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,Slow but gets there; wish this story could  be true somewhere- two main characters truly come across as made for each other- now that's hot.
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"Billed as a link between the tv show and the game, this is an OK little information rag. Its got some nice pictures from the game."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"Ya que es la ultima ruta, debiera tomarla y perderse en la misma.
Lo marquie igual con 3 estrellas porque todo libro siempre aporta al menos entretenimiento pasajero."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"If a book starts out with foul language especially GD, I won't continue reading it. I read just a few pages and deleted it from my tablet."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,It was just ok. No mistress ever just leaves with no drama! Too unrealistic. It could've ended in so many different exciting ways. Just not really impressed.
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"This book is just silly fluff. An entertaining read, but I had to mock it as I was reading it. Props to the author for the creativity."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,I'm going to figure out how to return Bon Appetit for a credit...not really into cannibalism.  My husband also quit reading this one after a few pages.
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"Even though it took me months to finish reading
this, which was a first for me, It was an ok story.
I could have done without the drama  though."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,I'm no prude but these stories or what pass for stories were just plain crude and disgusting. Not worth reading even if they are free.
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,If it was longer I would have loved it even more and scored it higher. Love the story but the length of the books are slightly annoying (so short)
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"The Sparrow by Jason Mott is a good short story where you get a chance to read a sweet short story before you read the whole book, The Returned."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,Interesting ..but not Poe. Not what  I expected. I guess I was expecting something more traditional. I'm sure you work will appeal to a different audiences. Good luck.
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"It was just okay. Nothing notable, mind-blowing, or earth-shattering. You get what you pay for with some of these cheaper novels, and it shows in the editing and execution."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"I rarely give up on a historical novel, but his book just didn't do it for me.  I agree with the reasoning of the other reviewers who gave up."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"This guy thinks he needs a bad chick by his side,but he has nothing but problems with this type of woman, finally he wishes up and gets a good woman"
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"Lots of drama in this story. Plenty of twists and turns but could do without some of the characters. Overall it was interesting, just busy. It is worth reading though."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"The book snagged me in the beginning, however it lost its spark half way through. I had expected a little more gusto since I have read other books by Dodd."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"The story of a man who built a denisty in Colorado Springs.  The many family members he loves and the dream of peace, security and love he hopes for."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"Great story but I still felt like there is a lot of unfinished details. I don't know, other than that I like the storyline and the mystery surrounding Natalie's secrets!!!"
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"Why she always threaten to leave and she keeps coming back. You can not want his money,but she kept coming back. She needed to make up her mine and woman up"
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,Good characters and storyline..just was more romance than adventure. .could have dis a bit more with it.  But it once again kept me reading..Just not as exciting as the others..
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,This is the third book in the series.  The writing is so so and there are lots of errors.  I kept purchasing the books because I like the story.
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"My mistake - yet another one where I didn't realize it was a PREVIEW ONLY, not the whole book.  It didn't tempt me enough to purchase the real book either."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,Typically this author has a better end product.  Book wanders all over creation doesn't blend the individual stories of the primary characters very well - disappointing read waste of time
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"This book was written with characters around mid twenties to thirties.but the language and content of the book is perfect for young teens, middle school or high school.
Or maybe just shallow adults."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"This was a very enjoyable storyline with lots of interesting characters, most from previous stories in this series.
This was not one of my favorite books or storylines, but overall it was okay."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"Too many small book for the price, Just combine into one. Enjoyed the book. Tired of buying so many pieces of the story. Can't give it a 5 Star for those reasons."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"I enjoyed this book and for a while I actually thought that both exes where the one and same guy so I was surprised with a ""oh so he wasn't in disguise!?"""
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"This was a quick, smutty read that makes me want to read the rest of the series!  I guess that's the point of short stories/novellas -- in that case, mission accomplished!"
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,This book was really sweet but quite predictable. I love mail order bride stories but it was never easy for these women and Emma's story made it look too easy even for fiction.
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,I liked better the other ones.  All Access and Broken Sound were far better!  This one has a lot of loose ends and it's not really as good as the others.
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"Eh. The humor was junior high level, the plot has been used before and the characters did not sound realistic at all. It's harmless, though, I just don't think it's worth 3 dollars."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,If I had realized how short it was I wouldn't have Dow loaded it .subject matter ok except they had been toooo long not to know what she wanted for the anniversary gift
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,The beginning was a little slow but once the story started to gain momentum my attention was caught and kept captivated.  I will definitely be on the look out for Book 2.
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,I appreciate the variety and new recipes this book offered but it just wasn't what I expected so maybe my expectations where too high or different to appreciate what was offered.
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,It was an ok book. It wasn't very exciting. I don't know if I would really recommend this book. I'm going to read book two in the series . I hope it's a lot better.
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"Story started great, was very interesting with good characters.  But the ending was very abrupt.  Would have liked the characters to have more of a relationship prior to the ending of the story."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,I could not stand the hero or heroine.  He was a jerk and she was a weak victim I had no sympathy for.  I skimmed most of it hoping it would end quickly.
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"Better written than her three previous novels --

My only complaint -- Taylor should not be ex-Army -- Taylor is a Marine.  He's got the improvise, overcome, adapt gene down pat. Hoorah!  Love Taylor!"
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,Basically porn.  But then I did read the whole book.  Not realistic but an escape for a few hours.  I was really put off by the main character is demeaned on several levels.
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"Come on, too much of a good thing is not a good thing. Just cause someone strikes a hit with one genre, other authors try to cash in on the idea instead of being creative themselves."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"I don't usually give up on a book because I think ""it will get better.  This book I finally gave up on and decided there was no hope. Starts out slow and stays that way"
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,Not a good read. The characters do not grow from book one or within this book. The situations are not believable. There is still an underlying interesting plot. That does not equal the weaknesses stated above.
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"These ideas sound awesome, but the fact that I can't see any finalised project just frustrates me! DIY projects should be more explanatory and not just only words, specially for someone who's not familiar with these crafts."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,A bit difficult to get into.  Wording seems as though the author has English as a second language. Poor editing.  Mistakes in grammar and misplacement of words.  Eventually grabs you to reach the end.
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,When I have to read the description of the book to give it a rating it was most likely not worth the read. If you want to kill time and spend $2.99 to do it it's your choice.
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"I have read James Kipling's books and thoroughly enjoyed them. This one, I had to force myself to read. The ending sucked big time. I can't say it in any other way. Very disappointed. So fake. So unbelievable."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"All this is about is sex.  Nothing to review. Can't say anything about the author or the content of this book as it is just  crud.
This is not recommended unless you are into a book about sex."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"The story about tangi and ZaBria was an exact story from another author (Tracee Boyd) beautiful damaged. only thing changed were the names. Not sure if I'm tripping, but somethings not right. Two different authors. Same exact words."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"I find myself thinking I wasted my time with this book. a zombie novel is about zombies. this book misled me into thinking I would read more action. I ended up getting the baby and the dog, Bos Bos"
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,It's a decent read though not the normal type of book I like to read. It's basically a book of short stories about the people who have found messages in a bottle& abbreviated versions of what the messages said.
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,I thought this story was pretty boring but a quick read and free.  I didn't see what the purpose of having a grandfather telling the kids this story which really had nothing to do with Christmas in my opinion.
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"""Void Star"" by JP Yager is IMHO an amaterurish, attempt to write an adult mainstream sci/fi adventure story. The prose is simplistic and aggravating. Not my cup of tea so I stopped reading at the end of the 3rd chapter..."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,The book was okay a new author for me. Not as attention grabbing as it could be and had a hard time staying with the story. Was interesting in some places and would try another book maybe from this author.
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,This is not one of her better stories. The storyline was choppy and abrupt at times and there were multiple editing errors. I have enjoyed her stories so far and will try again but this was fell flat for me.
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,The audible that I bought along with it only went half way through the book. This is a long and repetitive book with English from the 1800s that makes it slow and difficult to read. An updated version may be preferable.
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,I like the story line and the characters had potential but I felt the story was rushed and jumped to much I couldn't enjoy it as much as I usually enjoy shifter stories. Has potential when the next one comes out.
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"Not a very exciting book.  A little bit of suspense, a little bit of romance.i did not care for the way the story was told.  The characters were hardly believable.  Big plus no bad language or steamy sex."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"I bought this book for my kindle.  I thought the synopsis and preview look good.  I was unable to enjoy the story because parts of pages repeated.  So, I was unable to read the book and enjoy it."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,that's all I can say. love erotica. love all kinds. this was just dumb. Tacky and trashy came to mind and not the fun kind. forced myself to speed read through it to get to the other stories in the boxed set.
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"This was a hot short story, but as another reviewer pointed out, I was disappointed it was all a dream. It seemed a little cliche. Still, it was well written. I wish it had been longer. I'd have loved scenes from his pov."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,I didn't love this.  I was looking for something new in the genre because I feel like I've read all of it and this was too clich and predictable for me.  the character development was non-existent.  Just didn't like it.
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,Sometimes you gotta let go and let time take care of matters of the heart.  Nice love story once one of the main characters wised up to take notice that all she ever needed and wanted was within an arms length away.
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,It ended very abruptly. I was really enjoying the book and then it just ends. So much was left unanswered and it was just disappointing. It built to this great ending but stopped short. I would have liked there to have been something more.
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"The subject matter ok, but I wish I'd known it was about some 17-18 year olds. I couldn't finish the book due to not being able to relate to the characters. The storyline was believable for the age group just not what I expected."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,this was an ok book. if you liked the other dukes of war this one sounds promising but is slow and there is no closure with the other books. I always like to have all the books hooked up in the end. very disappointed.
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,Some of the series is offered on kindle unlimited but not all. It's random. The series is not worth paying for. Zoey is annoy and immature. Dax is over possessive and unyeiding. Also: all the popular Earth saying are stupid in a scifi book.
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,It was ok..h  was kind of a leech. I mean her older half sister (book 1) is one of the biggest country singer helped her get recognized. They share same father who had a double life. I didn't like either the H/ h.
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,This was a rip off of Ivy Symone's CRUSH series. Same storyline but with a horrible delivery. I knew I read this book before. Sorry if u are gonna read this storyline get the ORIGINAL one from Ivy Symone cause this is a terrible one!!!!!!!!!!!
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"The title states Cooking from the Pantry, but she gives a grocery list and some recipes to make from that list. Not what I was looking for or expected from the title. I'll look at it again and try a recipe, I'll try to anyway."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"I kind of wanted a little more - once I had gotten past the part of the book which in the beginning was kind of freaky, I guess I wanted more, it sort of cut you off just when u began to feel for the characters."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,Nice post Valentine's Day treat! Enjoyable short story. Rosalinda was a woman who knew what she wanted. I was hoping Trevor would've been slightly more aggressive but I get the feeling this was just the tip of the iceberg. Nice Den of Sin teaser Ms.
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,Ava is continually giving back the bracelet.  She jumps to conclusions and can't even confront the man she supposedly loves.  She is a winer and it hard to read what an immature woman she is!  Nico should be fed up and sick of her!
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"This was largely a retelling of the story. There is no development of the characters. It is very simplistic in the story and the vocabulary. I did finish it, but I could only skim the last half. Not worth my time or money, and I got for free!"
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"The premise  of the course was quite romantic and as a result the reader conjures imagines of the novel should be.  This book at times felt like a noble from the nineteen century.  Also it promised hot steamy sex, don't waste your money it contained none."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,This is one of the first books that really made me sleep cause is only about a girl with insaecurity issues that overcomes it with boobs to become a slut or person who used his boobs to go forward (in the book only talked of the process to buy her boobs).
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,This was a cute book but felt very rushed.  Nico and Kat meet and instantly fall in love.  His family seems very accepting for someone who just appearred in their life.  I was glad that she didn't forget her goals and education simply because she fell in love.
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"I almost gave up on this book in the beginning, but I'm glad I didn't. It wasn't nearly as good as ""captive in the dark"" but it had that feel. I wish there was a little more romance/love from Tane at the end. I guess that's not what their relationship is though."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"The book, Murder of the Mind by Ndea B, focuses main character Alexandria, who is grieving the death of her grandfather and experiencing visions of him instructing her to commit murder. The story is OK; however, it will leave you wondering if it was murder, mental illness or a dream! Three stars!!!"
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"A pretty easy read but it took me a while to get into the story. Overall, a good book, but I'm not sure what I got out of it other than the knowledge of how badly horses were treated in the 1800's. I'm glad that there are laws to protect animals today."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"A big let down until the very end which left you feeling good about the series. The series just became to long and it felt like the writer got himself into a ""deep dark cavern"" and didn't know how to get out. So a convenient, new storyline is brought up to get out."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"This should be, how to survive on an alien planet when your attacked, with no hope of rescue. Ensign Stone, now Governor Stone and his band of Marines, head on out into trouble doing what they do best.
Not as good as the first or third in this series, but still an excellent read"
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED.  AT THE BEGINNING I THOUGHT THIS IS GOING TO BE A GREAT BOOK, IT WAS FUNNY AND I LOVE
A FUNNY HUMEROUS STORY.  AS I READ ON IT WAS TOTALY BLAND AND BORING.  I WILL NOT WASTE MY TIME READING ANY MORE  BOOKS TO THIS SERIES."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"I love the inspirational scriptures and how the characters lean on God. My only complaint after reading this whole series...the problems between the couple dragging out too long...I understand misunderstandings as how they happen but when you are reading these stories, they seem to duplicate just with different couples. Made them drag a little"
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"Instead of just telling the story this author is forcing conflict between the main characters.  Advice to the author:  Go read Nalini Singh's Archangel series and get an education on anti-heroes.
My synopsis:  Supposedly mature adults in love acting like spoiled children with no hope of growing up.  Very frustrating read."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"I picked this book up free on Amazon. It was well worth the price I paid LOL!

It was an okay book. It read quickly and was intriguing even if a little predictable. The writing was okay. There was decent character development. If you are looking for a quick, fast read, this could satisfy that need."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"If it were the first 5 or six chapters of a book it would be great.  As a stand alone book it is too short, not enough character development.  I don't want to spend $20.00 or more to find out what happens.  $12.00 as a complete series maybe,  but no more."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"This was a good read a lot of drama, which kept me wanting more. Harmonie went through a whole lot to be so young. I cannot wait to read the next book to see how this all ends.

I would certainly suggest spellcheck before I had to re-read certain parts to make I was seeing things correctly."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,This book had a real good plot but the book was such a bore to read. It only takes me one day or less too read a book but this one I kept putting it down. I will be buying another book before I decide if this Author is one that I will follow or not.
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"I am sad to sad i was so disappointed in this very, very short story. It was way short and it felt like you started the story in the middle and then it ended abruptly. I love Joyce work and will read more of hers in the future, but this is not worth the 99 cents."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"I was excited to get such a bargain for one of the greatest commentaries on the Bible, however, after realizing I had to go through every book to get to the end, that is a lot of scrolling, too much scrolling. Please fix this and you will have a real blessing for those who study God's Word."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"This was free - thank goodness - or I would have been really put out.  I finished it even though I knew how it would end.  Just too much of the same dialog and way, way too many F words.  I love a good romance but this one did not feel real to me."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,I read the entire series and the writer kept me so engrossed in every detailing this book I was  literally pulling my teeth to get back to the main characters and their children and their lives and drama and excitement but the writer never got me there I wished I would have stopped at book 7 :(
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"Great story, a little hard to follow at times due to the number of proofing and editing errors. A lot of words were misused in sentences repeatedly. Otherwise it was a very unique story with good humor miixed in serious human travails and romance. I hope this author gets help with this in her future e-books."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"I can't say too much as the 1st. book was free.  However, I certainly am not going to pay $2.99 each for the balance of the story since each book is only minimal pages!  The Author should have held off and published as one complete book!  I won't be looking into anymore of his books."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,The story was ok at best you really should edit! The words in this book that were misspelled and words that shouldn't been in the sentence. Autocorrect while reading through this book is not what the reader wants to do. The book was boring the female lead character I really wanted to shoot her after the first chapter.
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"Not great, not terrible. It's short, and pretty much what you would expect from a romance novel. I was a bit disappointed that more wasn't done with the setting, but given how short it is, I guess Derr didn't have much time to expand on the world. Hopefully she'll come back to this world and write more sometime."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"A quick tale of revenge and second chance love that takes a sweet turn.  Not much plot, but good emotion.  Anthony runs a bit hot and cold, which was a little off-putting at times.  The best character is Antonia, and I am very excited to learn that she gets her own novella in The Dukes of Vauxhall."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"This book was ok.  Seemed a little slow at times talking about meaningless  things and hard to follow. I did like the interaction between Tristan and Lily, when they were hot, they were hot!!  Ended with a little bit of a cliffhanger, curious on where this story is going to go if there is a book 3."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"Sadly I have to say that the first person writing of this story was just monotonous.  I really tried to get into the story and did,  here and there,  but only to be pulled down by the dreary first person story telling that was almost fanatic in its embracing  of ""I."" It was just too much."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"This was a poor effort to an alien invasion tale.  The dialogue of all characters is identical with absolutely no unique distinction.  Altogether foolish prepper tropes, no real world experience applied.  Generals expressing concern over whether elite special forces units will be comfortable living rough....Oh!/Bugger!

I have placed this author on my do not read list.  Never again."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,I liked it and wanted to read the ending.  But...just too goody two shoes.  Everything worked out too well.  I loved the concept but things just fell into her lap.  Sorry - real life is not like that.  And that is the problem.  I was not pulled enough into this book to suspend my critical mind.
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,I downloaded the book Christmas Eve an I have time to read it. Well through out the book even the bonus books have a red ! Saying click here error in your download. Well the book seemed to download fine. But I am worried it has a virus so I am not going to read it. I just thought someone should know.
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"The entire story was very predicateble, this is what I liked the least. What I liked the best is her imagination. I also found that the entire story should have been in one book, not in 3. I suppose it was a matter of cost for the Author who, obviously,  earned more that way. I did not like this at all!!!"
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"The story was short but it was nice to read about Tristan, Keisha, Nate & Jada again. I hope that the next book is longer and picks up where this left off...too much left hanging. I'm loving Mrs. Clara & Rev. Johnson. I can't wait for their next appearance. P.S. The girl on the preview future cover needs a lil more sun."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"I am disappointed with the ending, regardless if I like the writers style if I want to see a world where the bad guy wins all I have to do is watch todays news. and to really top it off to quote one of the most depressing writers of the 20th century to justify said ending.  I won't read this author again."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"Barry Raspbody has a unique sense of humor.  Most of the jokes were a bit of a stretch.  There were a few good, although painful, puns.  He also had a few that makes one want to smack either their forehead or his.  They might be easier to understand  and appreciate if they were presented in a comedy routine."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"If you're hesitant to read this book because you're worried it might be too explicit, don't be.  Even though the storyline sounds like it could contain a lot of brutal scenes it was really pretty tame, like PG rated.  There were a few major twists I didn't see coming and it was a fairly quick and engaging read but nothing particularly upsetting."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"I enjoyed the story ok but I was disappointed in how short it was, how it ended and how I never really understood the guys with the guns.  This is the first book I have read by Susan that I was not thrilled to read.  I will not buy the next 2 in this series.  I felt overcharged for so little ."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"Watch out for the quiet shy types!  This ditty is about what's least expected and she's ready to shake up the town with her
""skill(s)"".  Fun I'm sure for some people, I'm not into the woman dominatrix thing but very tantalizing even to me.  It peaked my interest enough to finish it.  You should really check it out, it is very ""unique""."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"I liked this story, not exactly sure why this one took me so much longer to read than the other Sapphire Falls books. It took me almost a month to read. Maybe it's because Lauren was trying so hard not to like a town I loved? All in all the book was good, I still can't get over how long it took me to read."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,It was ok. Ques was doing way too much.  I mean way too much. Ebony should forgive Keishs but she should not let that girl back in her life on no type of level. So I'm going to need grandma Loretta (my grandma is named Loretta :)) to back off. Then I need to know why she ain't tell Edrise immediately about Ques. So irritating.
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"I got tired of waiting for something of substance to occur in this novel. The authors dumbed down writing style was way too trashy for me, so I gave up after 35 percent .I kept hoping that something resembling an interesting plot might develop but I felt like I was reading a bad soap opera, maybe there are people who like this style, just not me."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"So far, I have picked this up and put it down four times. Each time I picked it up, I had forgotten what I was reading. Just got to 24 percent of the way through, and this jarring inconsistency did it for me.  Chris tells the Secretary she doesn't drink, but several pages later, she's having a beer. Not sure if I can finish the book."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"I actually liked this ""book"" , and the first. But, I will pass on the rest of the "" series "" .
""Book"" one being free , and ""book"" two being a dollar kind of made up for the lack of story.
I do not enjoy books I can read in less than two hours.  Lazy author!!
No way I would pay over a dollar for those little snippets. Shame."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"While I thought the likelihood of two people quickly falling for each other after 14 years of never seeing each other and not having any contact with each other prior to their marriage of convenience infinitely small, I somehow still enjoyed this. The setting was peaceful, the lead characters were likeable, and the children were adorable. A fluffy, angst-free escape if you don't think hard about the plot."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,3rd book in the series 2nd in the Rick/Jordan saga. Rick is still an incredibly manipulative Jerk and his friends as well as Jordy continue to give him a pass. I feel that Jordy is too much of an enabler and allows Rick to manipulate him.there is a bit of growth at the very end of this part of the story. Hope to see more in the next.
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"Thus novel was centered around a four year old. There was no romance between the main characters. They never even reconciled, never went on a date but suddenly Jim says that he was falling in love with her. this could never have never happened when they never spent any time together. Seriously I couldn't believe what I was reading and to add insult to injury there's another book about their wedding."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"The female character was portrayed as stupid and thoughtless as she idiotically ignored all advice and caution in the face of danger taking all others with her.  No realistic woman would act so foolish.  Therefore, the author kept inventing unreal problems and solutions. The author should have kept the female real with real problems and not dragged out solutions.  I would not read this author again."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"Should have been a short story. Too many loose ends so very easily tied up in the end with a sudden plot twist. A real disappointment. Do not think Rissoli & Isles. I do believe these 'other' books must be written by somebody else as they are not in the same category as the Rizzoli & Isles books. Think ""Lifetime for Women"" and this book will fit right in."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,I loved the story line..... Great H and ok h (lost respect for her during the story due to some questionable and not very h like behavior).  I also found the story to be kind of long winded....and I found myself skimming through what to me was filler and fluff to lengthen the book.  I enjoyed the read but with could have done it in two books.
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"The two main characters interact well. The plot is a bit contrived, things just happen, but for the most part that's OK, too. I did not care for the obvious misspelling, poor grammar and the wrong homonym used in several places. Please get an editor, or at least a beta reader. Just because spell check says the word is spelled correctly does not mean you have used the correct word."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"This book is utter nonsense. It's written horribly, the sex is gratuitous and vulgar and the characters aren't engaging or interesting. I'm so disgusted that it's too late to get my money back. I bought the title thinking how interesting the story might be and now I just want to wash out my eyes and hope my IQ didn't drop too many points. The worst! Wish I could give negative stars..."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"Totally depressing. No real hope. All good people are and real caring is covered over with. what will get what I want for me,By the step mother and the next door farmer. Their difference with a user is,  they use people instead of drugs. Reality is too much with me in everyday life so my reading has to be somewhat promising. I did not like this book. W."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,This book was obviously thrown together. Not the authors caliber of writing. I have read her other books which were actually pretty good. There was not chemistry between the characters. The over the top sexual language was a turn off. I would nit recommend this book. I hope book 7 of Sin City showcases her her true talent. The story seemed to have been all over the place. I am so disappointed.
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"Once again, Christopher G. Nuttall demonstrates a keen understanding of human nature, military hardware and tactics and an extraordinary vision to create an all to believable future galaxy.  It is the challenges we are confronted with -- and how we overcome them -- that defines us.  In ""Retreat Hell"", the Commonwealth of Avalon is confronted with interstellar war, while at the same time confronting the weaknesses of their fledgling democracy."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"This book was an interesting read, although sometimes it went too fast.  There are lots of questions and not enough answers.  It doesnt skip things, but more glosses over anything that was interesting to know.  The grandpa was very confusing all the time, even when he was speaking mostly clearly.  For the price worth a bit of a read, but it didn't leave me interested in reading more."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"I didn't get through it. It just didn't flow well or something. It just wasn't my cup of tea, pick one. Maybe it was the guys hair moving and caressing her(Creepy)or reading about how sexy the guy was several times in the pages I read. Why do romance authors do that? Say it once and I pretty much got the idea. Maybe reiterate in a steamy scene, not at least once a page."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"The story was well written but left you wanting to know so much more about the characters intimate moments with each other. What there was left you wanting so much more. YOU experienced their downfalls, frustrations and longings but it stopped there. Doesn't speak well of a supposed lesbian love story.

Not a memorable book for me.

Will leave this one out of my library and search for an author who gives me more intimate details."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"OMG 19 books later & still no where, who writes this & more who  actually proof reads it? I'm no literary genius, but it's written from a teenagers perspective or at least that is how it appears to me I have gotten to the point of no return I cannot possibly read one more. I have to be left, just hanging total ""waste"" of money & time, I am ashamed to my core, DONE!!!"
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"I obviously should have read the blurb better... I really enjoyed reckless for cowboy in this series and was quite surprised to find this book had more than a smattering of bondage and even a visit to a bdsm club, very graphic content and not what I was expecting. Having said that if this is your cup of tea then you may enjoy this book. Very thin on plot and the characters are lacking in depth."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,This set of books is nothing but poorly written pornography.  At least have enough respect to edit your writing.  A responsibly placed comma or an appropriate capital letter does wonders.  Honestly the poor literary examples and every other page containing porn were more than enough not to complete this over advertised accumulation of pond scum.  Not to mention the storyline seems to copy that of a best selling novel and its movie.
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"Horrid! She's childish, hypocritical , repetitive, & completely dislikable. He's supposed to be alpha male billionaire , but begs, grovels, pleads, & bends over backward to become some Styrofoam vanilla ice cream cone for this chickNOTHING alpha about tgis dude! Boring! Repetitive ! Mundane! Longest an most boring sex scenes ive ever readim talking 20 plus pages of undressing, inner monologues, & grinding before another 10 pages of actual getting down to some boring intercourse."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"This was my first read for this author.  The story itself was fantastic, an excellent whodunit.  I really loved some of the characters.  There were definitely surprises throughout which I thoroughly enjoyed.  What didn't I like about this book?  The intimate scenes were almost painful, very hokey.  I would love to read more from this author, but would have to skip over the ""sizzling"" scenes as they just make me cringe."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"What is this story really about? I never got the hold of it. It describes a setting, some of the daily life, and then suddenly jumps a week, some months, some years? And then it's not about the mother any more, but the daughter, and goes the same way, I nice story describing the daily life, and suddenly you're way ahead in the future on your way somewhere else. Could have done with some hard editing this one."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"This is a reasonably entertaining book, though one needs to gloss over the often transparent plot and pretty one-dimensional characters.  The story line (prison world, alien technology with untapped potential, corrupt political system, rogue army general, a hero not fully aware of what he is, etc.) is not particularly original, but it hangs together and has no glaring holes even if how some of those holes are filled is at times not particularly credible or even meaningful."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"This book is a little shorter than the others, and you can tell. When it was hinted at in one of the previous books that Parker wanted privacy because of his BDSM inclinations, I thought a little more of it would be written in here. Instead there was almost none. Very little romance or sex, because it seemed that the story was more focused on the back story of the mutants, not enough on Parker and Elliott. I still liked it though."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"First off I'd say this book is more about spies, personal relationships, and naval life that includes submarines. It's action is sporadic and doesn't go far enough. If your looking for an action packed sub story then this book won't meet your expectations. If occasional sub action filled with soap opera drama is for you then by all means read this book. I gave it three stars because there were some highlights, just that they came here and there throughout the story."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"This is a nice compilation of recipes. The language is very stilted and would benefit greatly from a proofreading by an American speaking person, if that is the target audience the author is trying to reach. A lot of the words used are completely wrong, and the reader must then try to figure out what word she really means..which defeats the purpose of a quick recipe. Other than that, it's a quick reference for those nights when you are tired and uninspired."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"I like friends to lovers stories but this one was just OK.  I think for me the two had been out of contact for too long so the idea that either was harboring interest was a little far fetched.  Having said that, the characters had good chemistry and even though there was the usual angsty reason why one of them pulled away, at least the author didn't let that drag on for too long.  Not a  bad read."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,I'm so beyond the smart educated woman that still has silly hang ups about how people see her. Nala is an accomplished professor teaching at a University that her father runs. She runs into Ares a younger man who works on the groundskeepers crew. Despite these two feeling each other they fall victim to silly lies told to them by people out to pull them apart. Nala also lets her father get into her head and it really just dragged the book down.
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,The female lead (I cannot call her a heroine) is an idiot. In the beginning of the story she reminisces on how she should have listened to her friends about how bad her ex was and how she wishes she had paid more attention to their opinions at the time and maybe she wouldn't be in the mess she is in....and then she goes and does it again. I just can't support a character that I constantly want to shake some sense into.
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"After waiting for how many months to read another installment..... what a let down. First, nothing about Lindsey and who the father might be. Sorry Ms. Cunning but I am really disappointed in the new book. The writing is not her usual page turning, steam up your shower sex, the story was poor and the book did not advance any of the current story lines. There are plenty of up in the air plot lines to write about. Starting a new one is just annoying."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"I don't even know what I just read I couldn't even finish it, it was just so bad I honestly do not know how this horribly written book got so many 5 star reviews, When I could barely get past 15% of it. The writing was horrible and I couldn't find my grove at all finally I Justus started skimming through it BUT I still couldn't get into it and I love mc books, but sadly this was just not ready for the big times."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"The heroine in this book was one of the most annoying I've ever read.  Throughout the entire book she was hissing, snarling, sneering, and huffing at the hero, even after they'd established that they were together.  Honestly, this woman sounded like one unhappy person, all the way to the end.  I kept wondering what the hero saw in her, but maybe he's one of those guys who likes his ladies to act like a cat with their tail caught under a rocker."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"Honestly, I didn't finish reading this book. It was predictable (which is fine, but there wasn't much character building) and I lost interest halfway through the story. It wasn't horrible, it just didn't suit me and the mood I was in, I guess. I enjoyed the female MC but the male MC didn't seem very original and there were a lot of the same sexual descriptions used in all of his chapters--especially about her butt. However, I would say the title suits the story--fast, crass, and angry."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"It is interesting but I elected not to read the entire book. With all that is going on in government today, this book just hits too close to truth.
 I did read about 5 of the first chapters and the last chapter and decided I was glad I did not read the entire book because even though it is part of a series, it cannot be read as a stand alone. You are left hanging and so really need the next book to find out what happens."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"These are pretty gruesome stories.  The first three were fine but still filled with mental illness, mostly of children, the last one I had to pass.  There is a lot of violence and murder here.  A lot of mental illness and people treated pretty badly.  Does this all really happen?  Well, I guess probably so, but I don't want to read about it.  I must say this author writes really really well, but her subject matter does not appeal to me."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"I really liked the premise of this book- Noah and Courtney figuring out how much they mean to eachother before it's too late with some interesting twists. I liked it, I just didn't love it. I felt like they should have tried together long before, like they were not super strong characters. Something was missing for me. I took quite a few breaks reading this book. I really wanted to love this, I just didn't. I will definitely give this author another chance, though. The idea was great."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"I was not extremely pleased with this book. It was probably just 'ok'. I did like the Edinburgh descriptions and some of the conversations. For the most part, I was just a little bit bored with Northanger Abbey. I felt for Cat but I also felt that she was pretty self-centered and not such an interesting character. I did like the scenes when they went to events that were so crowded and packed with people. I guess this was just not my cup of tea so to speak."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"This was a HOT quick read. Brent and Eve are heading to The Beaudelaire to celebrate New Years and to finally consummate their marriage. Imagine their surprise when Remy (Eve's co-worker and best friend) is there as well. There is a past connection between Brent and Remy that Eve wasn't aware of.
Remy wants Eve for himself so will he force Brent out of their marriage or can they come to another arrangement.

I have read this book as part of the Seduced: Den of Sin Boxed Set 1 box set."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"Once an architectural historian, I have a weakness for books about architecture and/or renovation projects. So I had great hopes until I started reading this one. It was quickly apparent that the author knew very little about buying, renovating or even owning such a building, and since that was the scaffolding on which the story was to be told, the book lost my interest. There are good architecture books, by, for example, Lindsey Davis (a Roman villa in Britain) and Ellis Peters (a great cathedral). This isn't one of them."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,This story line had a lot of promise then crashed and burned out very quickly in the end .the one mindedness of the main character is a completely ridiculous and the lack of  insight is just plain stupidity . The way the author wrote his fights to where the main character gets into ridiculous situations get a lot worse as the story line goes on its gets sillier as the book goes into filling page's. A wasted opportunity  to really do something special  with the story line .
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"Bad romance is a story where stepsiblings fall in love. Writing was ok both main characters not so much likable. They want to be together they don't want to be together. He will stay away from her than not. She won't marry her fianc but she will. Confusing. Make up your mind already. And in the end: oh I was at the Hospital with someone Im late why don't I make a test. WTF?
But the sex was really great and it has an HEA.

Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"I'm a huge JB fan - love all her books some more than others.  But this one definitely not.  I've been looking forward to Penni and Jackal's book forever and What a big disappointment.  It's boring, and I'm not liking Penni - I had to stop reading I can't continue right now - I had to take a break - from what I read it doesn't get any better.  But I'll pick it back up at some point.  I sure hope Train and Killiyama 's book is better."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"This book wasn't too bad, somewhat too short of a read and it does have a cliff hanger. Spoilers ahead. Harley had just been released from prison and headed back to the only place she knew as home. Her father was dead, her brother was bad news, and the only other person she could turn to shunned her. Colt offered for her to stay with him until she could figure things out.
 Grammar and punctuation is good. Characters are not mixed up. I would recommend this to anyone who doesn't mind buying the next book."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"I really enjoyed the 1st book, THINGS UNSEEN. But, what the heck? The author veers from an interesting, dystopian world with strong characterization in the 1st book into heavy handed religion in the 2nd. C.J. Brightley is a good writer but rapidly lost me in long (LONG) biblical discussions. If you are up for it, maybe you will want to hang in there to the end of this story (I quit half way) and even onto the next. For me, this was a disappointment and I doubt I will be reading more of Brightley's work."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"This is the first book by this author that I have read and, unfortunately I found it quite disappointing.  I never felt a connection to the heroine and then I really didn't like the lies she told her supposed best friend, who had helped her and also set her up with her cousin.  She continues with her lies to the hero and his friends to almost the very end.  This dishonest behavior is from a woman who is portrayed as a devout Christian.  The hypocrisy was off-putting and the subsequent HEA not believable."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"I really enjoyed this story. The characters were likeable. The reason for three stars- I learned more about the characters form the summary than from the actual book. I understand this was a ""short"" story,  but it felt off gleaning essential (and nonessential) character quirks and even general information solely from the summary. Some of this added to the story, even explained a character's motivation to do or not do something, and a lot of this information wasn't to be found within the pages of the book. (I would be more specific, but I really hate spoilers."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"Not worth $,99. Talk about a short story!  This is a short, short story. Just an epilogue to the book ""Never Surrender"". It is a nice epilogue but very brief. Always love her writing and she really portrays the emotions of her characters so you can really sense what they are going through and feeling. Cute little chapter but doesn't give you any real information about Bay & Gabe and their story that you need to pay for. She just had their twins and they are happy."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"Im sure every guy has fantasized about crossing boundaries with an employee, or is it just me haha. While reading this book it made me realize how I can keep my work environment safe from relationships, gossip and negativity. This book will provide you with great content explaining how boundaries work in a professional organization, and also teaches you the right approach to communicate and make friends within your job. The book is pretty dull and could maybe use some entertainment, but any business owner or employee might want to check this book out for a better work environment."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"Maybe it was just me, but the way this one was written made it really hard for me to get into the story.  I was constantly sighing, rolling my eyes and thinking ""really, please tell you you did NOT just say that!"".  The romance was a one-day instalove that was so corny it wasn't entertaining, believable or even likeable.  The ""fight scenes"" were a joke (it was like watching a movie fight where the camera is pointed at their feet) .....sounds terrible right?  It was! There was no incentive to read another book at all."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"While struggling to find an adjective to describe this book - the word that sprang to mind was 'childish'.
It reads like the author read a book entitled 'How to write a novel' - then tried to cram all the 'hints' into this book.
The plot is (basically) OK - but the telling of the tale is infantile.
The reader could constantly feel that the author was 'talking down' to them.
Many of the scenarios and occurrences are truly laughable (laugh-out-aloud laughable) in their improbability.....
Then there's the annoying - and silly - open-ended 'ending' ---- leaving the entire rationale of the tome unexplained."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"Received an ARC for an honest review.....
I'm trying to figure out if the other reviews and I read the same book.  The story was kinda disjointed.  The conversations between characters didn't feel like any conversations I have heard before, not at all believable.  Almost like reading a book badly translated from another language.  Weird.  You wanted to sympathize with Tony because he was trying to do the right things for his daughter, but his thought process didn't fit his character.  Cassi is sometimes way to flakey to be believable.  The book is rather disappointing."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"I gave the book two stars because at least the author tried to teach the reader about wool and spinning, but that's about the only entertainment value I could find. I couldn't get into the book. I just couldn't find the rhythm or flow anywhere. The writing style is very juvenile and just odd. I couldn't finish the book but at 35% I couldn't invest anymore time. Here's some text from the last page I read so you might understand what I mean. ""Slowly, the lid to the trunk creaked open and just like he knew, Henry emerged from the chest."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"It's rare when the film version triumphs over the novel original; however, that's the case with Jane Austen's ""Mansfield Park."" Unlike the clever Elizabeth Bennett of ""Pride and Prejudice"" or the lovely and lively Emma, Fanny Price is moralizing and priggish to a fault. Even Austen's own mother declared Fanny ""insipid""! I love the other novels, even the underrated ""Lady Susan,"" but I could not finish this one.

Instead of reading the novel, enjoy the 1999 film version:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mansfield-Park-1999/dp/6305907145/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mansfield Park (1999)</a>. Frances O'Connor creates a spunky, witty version of Fanny Price that deviates from the novel and is all the better for it."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"Hmm.  The first novel was great.  This was...not as great.  Not sure whether it was a 3 or 4 star for me, I rated it as 3.

It just didn't grab me like the first one in the series did; the space battles were....not believable.  The internal political/military conflicts were again, not believable.  Riding the spaceship down to the planet and surviving was...not believable.

Just too many things that broke my suspension of belief.  Will buy the next in the series to see where it goes, but if it is the same as this one, probably the end of it for me."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"Boy did I go wrong with this book. I didn't know this had so much sexual content and far too little Sci-Fi. There was no need to have physical and sexual abuse and I stopped reading because that was where it was going. I'm not pleased because had I been warned in the blurb I wouldn't have gotten this to start with.

My copy came from Net Galley, Im sure they didn't know that it was not rated properly there. I left this review to warn others so that they didn't make the same mistake I did, thinking this was Sci-Fi. This review is entirely all my own."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"What could have been a really powerful story about a strong female character was completely spoiled by an unnecessary amount of pornographic sex. Former Capt. Kacey O'Donnell, Marine combat helicopter pilot, recently home from Afghanistan is visited by the love of her life, retired Navy SEAL, Nathan Weatherly. Nathan has come to the sleepy New Hampshire town when his former BFF lets him know that Kacey is in need of an intervention. Throw in a really great plot line about a kidnapped pre-teen who is also in need of help and the action gets good. So... if you can speed read through the smut, you may have a good read."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"If the first reviewer is right then reading Forbidden is a necessity.  I have not yet read Forbidden, and had hoped this short story would peak my interest.  It did not.  I see that Dekker has written another Thomas Hunter inspired fantasy.  Although  have read the Circle &The Lost books -Loved them- I personally am ready to try something different and unrelated.  The characters in this short fiction are dry and flat and the story line seems a bit wierd and unrealistic.  I might give Forbidden a try, but this short story was not much of a tease.

Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"I don't like to be negative, but I am an avid reader and I don't have much of a monthly budget to get books, so when I make a purchase I really expect value for my money. While I do believe that opposites attract, the fact is people do not change over night and, least of all, someone who has grown in such a black and white world as Chandler. I can understand that the book length meant that there would not be much of a plot and it could feel rushed, but I have read shorter stories that have worked for me. I just don't buy the plot or the characters."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"This book wasn't great but it wasn't terrible either.  It was a little hard to get through.  I felt myself skipping over some of the pages.  It didn't grab my attention.  The ending was better than the rest of the book and almost makes me want to read the second. I didn't really connect with the characters.  I just felt blah about all of it.  I wouldn't really recommend this book.  Its just a hard read.  There isn't too much of a student teacher relationship, well it doesn't feel like that.  Its almost like the author got bored writing this book in some parts too."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"I got this as a freebie and thought it might be good based off the synopsis and the large amount of reviewers giving this book a 4.2 rating at this time of this review.

I was bored right off the bat, but I pushed myself to 34% into the kindle version thinking that it had to get better. The first person point of view felt odd as she seemed to talk to the reader and expressed her thoughts. By reaching to 34% into the e-book there's no romance whatsoever even thought the main character is now in love with her billionaire, and I feel like I know too much about running a grocery store at this time."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"The book was long on description, long on conversation, but short on action.  The author has created this large and elaborate world which I am certain is true to the Gaelic culture.  He wants the reader to know this world as well as a result the first half to two-thirds of the book seems to drag.  Then when we do get some action it seems to be written in such a way as to not worry or Frighten the youngest of readers.  At the very end  it got more  interesting to build up to the next book.  I will probably read the next one in the series, but I feel no urgency to."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"Good start for an author. I'm not sure if this is the author's first book or not, but it read like a beginner. Still, no obvious grammatical errors and every consistent writing (as far as tone and flow). The story could be deeper (read very plain), and the dialogue needs to be smoother; less forced, less formal. The sentences felt choppy and a bit elementary. Needed emotion because it felt very one dimensional.  I didn't find myself falling into the story as I would of a veteran writer, but very good start. I don't regret reading this one, but I won't go recommending it necessarily. I hope this author keeps writing because she'll only get better. Lots of potential."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,I think the relationship should of been built up more between MJ and Noah. It seems they just jumped right into it. One minute he was thinking about killing here and the next she's getting oral sex on the beach. It moved to fast. The whole Aristotle part in the book was od creepy. Didn't understand it. Neither the gypsies part. I would say it gave the book another dimension to it. It was not just about gangs and stuff. Was it needed? To me no. The book started off great and it was funny and kept the reader entertained. But towards the middle it started to get weird. I'm like it's it a dark book or a paranormal book. Not my favorite by Kenya.
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"Although this is part 2 of the trilogy it does not start where part one left off and there is only minimal references to the content of part one. In this part they are trying to recover the ""amber moon"" which is the belt buckle of an elf I am not giving the plot away as this is known from page one. The author develops the story with other worlds which are well described as are the characters, it might have been me but although the characters are well described they do not seem developed so that I could care about them or even visualise them. The plot is not very convoluted but there are a number of directions that it turns in."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"I bought this book on my Kindle while I was waiting so I would have something to read.  I thought it sounded like a nice read, not.  I did not like all the sexual stuff.  Angel is 10 years older than Luke and that was a problem for me.  Angel has had a horrible life, yet comes across as a sad angel... a goddess in her looks.  No way would she had looked like she did at her age and with her life style.  Also a lot of the men were trying to have their way with her where ever she went.  I was disappointed with the book and do not recommend it.  It was $3 waste for me."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"This book starts out as many romance novels do.  We are introduced to a struggling heroine who has been abused in past relationships and struggles to find love.  The hero is a jerk who we are meant to dislike, but I found him even more irritating then most.  About three chapters in, I was totally bored and almost didn't finish it.

But, as a person who hates leaving a book unread, I did read it all the way through.  As I got more into the story, I become more attached to the characters as they work toward overcoming whom they were to become who they do.  I am glad I finished it.  I did enjoy the story, but I really didn't crave it."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"This is not book #1 in a series, it's part 1 of a serial.  This is a very well written, interesting story, but I absolutely hate to be lied to by authors and/or their publishers. There was nowhere in the book summary that stated that this would only be a partial story, and one would have to purchase additional ""books"" to read the rest. It advertised a series, but a series is a group of books that have related characters and/or storylines. This is a serial, where only a portion of the story is told, leaving the reader with a cliffhanger at the end. Why should I spend my hard-earned money on an author who has already been dishonest with me? Pity. I was really enjoying this story."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"I enjoyed most of this book. I liked how the author took time to develop the characters and their relationship. *spoiler alert* however, the person she ended up with seemed rushed and how it happened seemed completely out of character. She commits herself to Dylan but is back in town for less than a day and admits being in love with the other guy, which the readers didn't know a whole lot about. It just seemed unfair to spend the time growing the characters relationship with Dylan, only to feel robbed at her developing relationship with the guy she ends up with. I did however enjoy the book until that point so I would consider picking up another book from this author in case this one was a fluke."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"I started out excitedly reading this novel but soon lost interest.  In fact, it took me several months to finally finish it.  I felt the author treated the main characters like cardboard cutouts:  there was no real life to them and they acted very stereotypically.  Also, I thought that the plot would jerk forward at times leaving out important details.  Finally, the plot seemed too far-fetched to have happened in the deep south.  Would a plantation owner's daughter really have been a slave runner and married a Native American man?  And after William killed Thomas with an arrow I do not think that he would have remained alive.  Other plantation owners would have hunted him down and killed him in real life, I believe."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"So-so.  That's how'd I'd describe this romance collection.

As far as adventure goes, it was great.  Although, the ""quest"" was resolved way too easily.  All the sudden it was just over, which was highly unsatisfying.

The two main characters fell in love too easily.  Almost a love of convenience, in fact.  There could've been so much more.  At time, you see a glimpse of depth in the hero, but it quickly disappears.  Even the steamy parts were lacking because you didn't feel any emotional attachment between the two characters. It seemed out of place, even.

If you are interested in historical accuracy and developed characters, skip this one.  If you want a story to entertain you on a rainy afternoon, it will do the trick just fine."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"After the preview it slows way down and nothing happens until about half way through.  Then the action picks up.  About half the narrative is devoted to the difficult connection and varying love interests of Kam.  She never really commits.  I'm surprised Seth wants a woman who is so unsure.

As detectives or spies, neither of them amount to much.  They cannot even trace a vehicle, though they seem to know this is possible.  And they go off half cocked and unprepared.  Even down into a mine without a map or a clue, followed by elves with guns.  The resolution, i.e. the identity of the bad guy, is contrived.  He doesn't exist in the plot until the end.  It wasn't terrible, I'd say OK."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"The story was okay but Free and Reign got on my nerves with all that attitude. It's okay to play hard to get and let a dude know you not to be played with, but after awhile it got nerve racking. Like really? These dudes just saved yall from being sold to Jamaicans and yall still copping attitudes? Then Free got upset and overly dramatic when she found out she's pregnant when she did nothing to protect herself from getting pregnant. Who does that? Reign stayed just dragging King along. Like they got some serious growing up to do. I like King and KD though. I don't think there should be a part 2; this could have been one story but all authors are doing that now a days which sucks at times."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"The hero of this novella was perfect.  He was romantic, masculine, loving, etc. and so I read this story mostly to get to his happily ever after.  The heroine was annoying.  I'm a little tired of the cliche storyline where the woman doesn't want to get involved with cop/firefighter/generic hero because of the possibility of future loss.  It's a bit over the top and has been done many times over.  My biggest issue with the heroine is that she would leave her husband without any explanation.  Who would do that?  And why would he want her back.  But, this is a romance so the play acting that they have to do in front of the heroine's family is funny and there is a happily ever after."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"I selected this book for my book club and wish now that I hadn't, the synopsis made this book seem like quality book.  The grammatical errors, lack of character substance and real story line makes it appear to be written by a child.  Yep I said a child, certain descriptions used i.e. Tee's bathroom scene ---really did we need a description of him using the bathroom...and how vulgar to learn he doesn't wipe and the author wants us to believe that all the woman want him and his 4 incher...  I know why the writer chose anonymity, tho I am tempted to send an email to the account frequently referred to in the book to tell him/her how crappy the book is.... not sure I can finish it not sure I want to."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"After finishing The Cypress Project, I was eager for more, so I grabbed the other two novellas for the series. I wish I had I known, before buying the Kindle version, that this one was available for free online, because it was not nearly as long or satisfying as the previous novella. The cover is absolutely stunning, yes, and the content is interesting. Its just that it was over before I knew it, which was really disappointing. The glimpse of a new secret on Arras was definitely cool (and came in handy when reading the next book), but it was just way too short. Why did I rate it the same as The Cypress Project then? Well, I liked the content  I just wanted MORE! Seriously, save your money and just read this one online."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"I just finished this book. With all due respect to the author, I have a problem with this book. I am not saying that the author is lying. I suppose there is a possibility that Simpson did confess. It simply seems to me that given that the author admits to having made up stories about Simpson in the past, the credibility of this interview is questionable. The book is well written, and for that , I'll give it 3 stars. I'm sorry I couldn't give it more, and I don't necessarily believe that Simpson is innocent. I simply question the veracity of the story based on information given by the author himself. Ultimately, I can neither encourage nor discourage the reader. It's simply a book you'll have to read for yourself and form your own opinions of."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"I am probably not the best person to write a review for this book. I love this series when it first came out, and now with each book I just get more and more disappointed. This book had the same unanswered sub-plots  the others books in the series have with no real connection to the other books. I understand the author wants each book in the series to stand alone but it annoys when each feels like it should have a sequel. I did like the development of both the characters and the romance. The sex was typical for these types of manlove books. I was just annoy cause it didn't connect or update on any of the other books in the series. Really this is not a series!!!! These should all just be stand alone books."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"While the teaser on the book jacket moved me to buy this book, I couldn't finish reading it. The writing is uninspired, predictable. The story seems formulaic, safe - the sad stories of several women who meet at a knitting circle. The sadness is brought out pretty well, especially initially about the main character Mary's loss. But too much of sadness going on and on works against the story, I feel, so I began to ignore the emotional meanings and look for the story.

I tried to keep at it, but I gave up halfway, which is rare for me to do. I actually skipped the stories of two of the women - you know they are coming, and you don't care about any of them so why should you be forced to read what sad things they went through? Disappointing book."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,What's with this unmentioned cliffhanger crap??? I was lured in to read this free book but I will NOT be purchasing the other TWO books to get to a predictable end. What wasn't predictable from the description was that the H was going to be a dumb F.. Amnesia from an accident? After coming out of a coma the H researched EVERYONE to help know who they were EXCEPT the one his amnesiac mind should have and that's the clearly lunatic scammer of a fianc&eacute;. How do you totally lust for the h but treat her like crap on a stick but your supposed fianc&eacute; who know one likes and her character is more than questionable you allow to squander your billions but give her all the respect she doesn't deserve?? And again you failed to mention this crap was a CLIFFHANGER.... Sorry hunny.
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"Generally speaking I'm a big fan of Reynolds. His hard sci-fi opera stuff is incredible (the House of Suns stories? Are you kidding me? AMAZING! Revelation Space? Masterpieces!!). This though was just so dull and derivative with perfunctory sexy sex character interaction and whatever. I honestly just couldn't be brought to care about any of it. I ended up putting it down due to utter indifference.

IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER. I started reading this immediately after finishing Cixin Liu's Three-Body Problem trilogy and frankly ANYTHING I might have read following those books didn't stand a chance. Liu's three books might be the finest science fiction I have ever read, ever. As such, it's kind of unfair to review something after reading those science fiction masterpieces. So please take this review of Merlin's Beard (sorry, Merlin's Gun or whatever - who cares?) with a big honking grain of salt."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,First book was good but the second so awful!!!! I stopped reading it when I got to her x boyfriend and how he treated her. It was just too much!!!ugh! I feel disappointed cause the first book was not so bad and she seemed a strong character. I had read what Wendy wants and it was cute.. That was the only reason why I gave this book set a chance. It's not right for a little girl to do grown up stuff and that right there was the last straw. Well lesson learned no more from this author..I'm not a prude but it's way too much!!!  If it had just told the story of her leaving and her life in hiding...The level of abuse was really something I can't get into and I really feel others will feel this way too. DISAPPOINTED IN THE EXTREME!!!!

Stand alone -HEA
Quick read - alternating points of view
Let me start off by saying the story itself was ok. There were a few errors that were distracting/confusing. The reason why Robyn was kicked out at age 15. The whole family dynamics was off. There story in the beginning of the book was not what was revealed at the end. the relationship between Garrick and Robyn pretty much happened over night. Robyn was very independent and she worked hard to pay her bills and finance her degree. Garrick wanted to take care and protect her. He was possessive and bossy. They clashed a lot. But the make ups were hot and sexy.
There was a lot of drama in a short period of time. Robyn became a magnet for trouble. Near rapes, stalkerish ex, drug dealers etc. Everything wrapped up nice and neat in the end."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"The biggest problem I had with this is that it was written in first person present tense. I hated that from the first sentence to the last. I couldn't stop thinking about the scene in the movie The Emperor's New Groove where the guy gets mocked for humming his own theme music. This book seemed to be humming its own theme music by Carmella telling me herself every movement she made as she does it. ""I stumble through my apartment door"". ""I navigate the seven paces to my galley kitchen. "" I take a huge bite. "" It all felt unnatural. So the book lost a star in my rating just for that alone. The story was okay although I found aspects of it unbelievable. I can't explain that without a spoiler. Sex: A number of references to it having happened (no descriptive scenes) and a little innuendo. Language: A variety of swear words."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"I really tried to like this series. I've read, well quickly skimmed through all the books so far. I won't continue to read anymore. I really felt the story as a whole was just incredibly boring and instead of smart, courageous women we get bratty, careless teenage girls trying to rebel. The dialogue did not reflect adult conversations at all. Plus all 3 books are boring, the thing is these could really be great stories if some effort was put into it. Oh, and they are all in serious need of some quality editing. The poor editing just made the stories even worse. The potential is there for a good action packed sci fi romance but I think the author needs to write adult women into the roles not teen girls...and they're crappy teen girls at that. I've given this author 3 tries, I won't read anything from her again."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"I've read the series from book #1 ... and enjoyed as a series of light / quick reads.  There is a decent plot line and the story does move well.  Unfortunately, the editing, spelling, grammar, consistency of names, etc. is absolutely deplorable.  I feel Jaden Skye has an excellent talent for coming up with the series / story plot, but clearly cannot edit or word process his own work.

Jaden:  Hire an editor!

I have found errors in many Kindle Books that I've read ... perhaps one maybe two in a given publication.  And I can live with that.  But not like this.

Amazon should do something ... require a standard level of text quality or require an author to pay Amazon for an edit check prior to publishing.  AMAZON SHOULD BE ASHAMED TO SELL THIS QUALITY LEVEL.

Part of me is sorry that I bought the whole series."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"What did I just read? Honestly, going in to this story I didn't realize it was going to be so short and have such a cliffhanger and I don't think the story ended at the appropriate moment. It's like having a movie cut out in the middle of the scene. This story actually felt that it was placed somewhere in the middle/beginning middle of a story. By the end of the book I didn't feel that I knew any of the characters and don't feel invested in the story at all. The premise is interesting, but there's not enough in this book to make me read the next books.

Also, this is not the complete series. You get book one with this download and then if you write a review and send the author a screenshot of it you get the rest of the series. I'm especially not pleased by that sort of underhandedness."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"This book is like dragon-style chick lit. And that isn't a bad thing.

In ""Never Deal with Dragons"", Myrna is a professional dragon mediator. As one of the few humans who can talk to the dragons who have taken over the world, Myrna is in charge of dealing with all of the crap that dragons bring to the human realm. However, is she up to the task of working with her ex-boyfriend on a high profile dragon mediation case that could change her career?

This book was fun and well written, which I didn't quite expect. It was surprisingly clever, super light, and an easy read. Did it keep my attention all the way through? Not 100%. However, the heroine is really likeable and the world is interesting. I enjoyed this book a lot and I'll be looking for more from this author in the future.

Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"I'm going to be completely honest and say I'm still trying to figure out if this book was just ok or just something that could have been ok but left me feeling like it was missing quite a bit it had too many cliches.

Jagger comes from not so great of a childhood and Tatiana comes from a childhood of abuse, so they have something in common which is the crappy childhoods. And of course, it's what brings them together which is maybe what I found so cliche.

He's an ""underground"" fighter and has been in trouble with the law yet he is the one who gets in trouble because he tries to help her.

I don't want to do spoilers so the best I can say is - it's sad when you know exactly what direction a story is heading and you keep reading hoping every cliche won't be used.

Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"This is no hearts and roses type of vampire romance.

He meets this sulty beauty again in the hospital parking lot. He has to help her. From then on, this fiery couple go on a whirlwind ride to stay alive from the police and the Cartel. I can honestly said I really enjoy this scorching story. I could not put this book down. On a personal note: I want alittle riled about the police bashing of the SAPD. A wife of SAPD officer that was not my cup of tea. I highly recommendation this book. I received a complimentary copy from NetGalley for an honest review."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"Some may enjoy this overpriced series. I did not. These books are badly in need of an editor and a more interesting main character. Lexi Graves is shallow, often silly, and altogether a bit of a bore. Lexi also has a really hard time figuring out who the villain is until she has missed many of the clues, messed up the investigation, and gotten herself into a desperate situation that she then has to be rescued from.

Although the secondary characters are well-drawn, and the plots are interesting enough, the series as a whole does not justify the price.  I paid for the set, based on the good reviews, but I was having a difficult time reading past all the grammar mistakes and language oddities until I hit on the happy solution of bookmarking all the errors as if I were grading a paper. By the end of the third book I had more than 100 bookmarks."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"What a terrible end to this series.  I loved this character and her gargoyles from the first novella that I read but this book was technical with almost no heart or development for the few characters there were.  I was completely bored with the formation of crystals and what it took to form the crystals.  I felt like I was in a cave forming crystals through out most of the book.  That is what I mean by the book being too technical.  If there was such a thing as gargoyles, this would be the manual on how to make your own gargoyle. The writer spent way too much time on that and not enough time on developing the romance and bringing life to the final story in this series.  I miss the people and the gargoyles from the previous books.  This book felt like a novella that was dragged out."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"I was excited to see a new Christian DD book because you don't see very many in the DD world. This book was okay the characters were young and still in high school so at times they came off as very immature. The town they lived in and the school they went to seemed a bit unrealistic, the fact that Ashley's father could go from never spanking her to as harsh as was felt unbelievable. Ashley's character really frustrated me the constant back and forth on her feelings for Jackson, and Jackson was really pushy about getting married. Throughout the book we get to watch them go through marriage classes and that's when it starts to feel like a ""how to"" book. There are only a few spanking scenes in this book and only one between Ashley and Jackson.
I would have liked more of the romance between Ashley and Jackson minus everyone else. A follow up would be nice!"
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"I found this book both very confusing and sort of boring. And not only that, but it seemed to drag on endlessly. It took me until mid-way through the third chapter to even figure out that Juliet was a grieving widow, and why? And when she came home and found a naked man in her pool, she acted like she didn't even know who he was, and yet, he had been around for years while caring for her sick husband. I found that really, really odd. There was a lot of the inner thought process going on in both of their heads all through the book, and they weren't even complete thoughts, at that!

I have read books by this author before and enjoyed her humor and quirkiness, but not this time. I will continue to read her books in the future, though, because she normally does a fantastic job. IMO- I don't know why, but something just felt a bit off with this one."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"I read about a chapter of this book. The writing is irritating, being 99% heroine's inner dialogue, with tiny phrases of conversation every page or so. The action freezes solid while we examine the heroine's inner thoughts, her past, her toenail polish ...

Forcing myself onward, I discovered this chick is truly too stupid to be out on her own. She let her former boyfriend walk all over her, steal her blind and humiliate her on national tv. This doesn't fit what I've heard of successful ballerinas, who have to be intelligent and tough as steel to make it to the top of their profession. It also does not give me a heroine I can relate to. Now she's chasing after a cage fighter ... and is so TSTL she leaves her expensive coat with cell phone and wallet in a cheap dive bar while she pirouettes off to chase the hero.

I suggest the hero run the other way as fast as his muscular legs can carry him."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"I liked the plot of the book, but I'm very confused by the ending. It seems as if it's not a standalone book, but that the second is from her friends point of view, but about Stephanie and Denny's relationship. To each their own style, but I find series better if they are all in one point of view, or if they have a happy ending and then move on to other characters stories. I just feel like it's left hanging.

I feel like the dialogue was forced. Some of the things the characters said had me confused. I feel like in some places info was just to be assumed by the reader and not explained. I felt like it jumped around in some places and then in other things were dragged out. Things happened without explaining and I had to reread chapters thinking I missed something.

All in all, it wasn't bad. I love books with babies, I just feel as if I'm left hanging and have no way to fix it."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"I really enjoyed this book. It was a fun read that kept me interested. I couldn't help feeling for what Paige went through as a kid and how it shaped her life and her families. It truly shows how when one person in a family is ill, it affects everyone.

I'm glad that Paige grew up strong and was able to finally make her life away from her family, and have a little independence that she sorely needed. When Paige loses her job she pulls herself up and takes charge of her life and becomes her own boss.

A big move, but one she's ready for.

You'll really enjoy how both Paige and Jake grow. Because Jake is Paige's brother Matt's friend he is taboo to her, and vice versa. But somethings the heart wants what the heart wants.

Of course at times I wasn't always a fan of Jake's attitude, but as the book progressed he got better. I'm really looking forward to the next book in this enjoyable series.

ARC received for a honest review"
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"3.5 Stars, I really, really enjoyed this book. It is a super sweet romance and it just soaks in the couple time and we get so many phases of the relationship. Agh. Love it.

Aaron is completely sweet and well a wish fulfillment hero for someone as hurt and angry as Zack. Zack's voice in wonderful with great asides to the read and wry self reflection.

Aaron is a bit of a doormat but there is some nice conflict around making sure Zach and Aaron are partners in this relationship.

As much as I liked it, and I did, there are issues with the writing in terms of unresolved stuff,.

Aaron's relationship with Zach's brother and wife need to be discussed. There is so much co dependency in Aaron.

Zach needs therapy for his childhood trauma.

The plot pacing is sluggish so while even though I enjoyed it, others will be driven batty.
Aaron has no pets. He is a vet. We never get to see his love of animals.

And there is other weird stuff but I liked it anyway, A lot. lol."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"It is just not particularly consistent.  A main character gets shot several times and survives hours on a train with minimal first aid.  The villain doesn't shoot him in the head or the chest? They come out of a forest to a train station that has only one stop and no one notices?  Neither main character can get their access card into the card reader, although they have been standing in line watching all the people in front of them insert the card.  The guards let someone suspicious approach them, even though they have their gun drawn?  The guy is planting explosives and not keeping them on a short fuse, so the bad guys, who are watching on video can disarm all ten to fifteen of them? I mean, please?  Sorry; only so many hours in my life.  Not enough to read the next two books.  This doesn't even get to any type of twisted issue with the villain causing a miscarriage as some type of revenge on the father."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"I couldn't finish. It was painfully one-dimensional to me: the reader was told how to feel about every character and situation from the beginning (I tried to let it slide, because beginnings can be rocky even with great stories).
Fav part was when the Hero was talking to an evil henchman, and he yells, ""How much are they paying you?"" And the henchman replies some amount that means nothing to me, and the Hero says, ""It's not enough,"" and flies into a confident, low-stakes martial-arts butt-kicking, somehow never revealing his face. It might actually be cooler and more believable the way I described it. So cheesy!
Then I got bored: erotic dreams of characters who have no emotional attachment to each other doesn't interest me at all, especially because I'm not attached to either of these characters. I was rolling my eyes about their lusty waking inner-monologues, too. And then our Hero was thinking about masturbating on and off for three pages and there's no chance of this ever feeling romantic to me. Might as well tell me his tragic backstory of bowel movements."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"I want to give this story more stars, but there are a few aspects that I find too far fetched which brings it back to 3.

The story is well written, the characters are very relatable and easy to like. But my issue with the story is how so many characters have special powers or abilities for one reason or another. Yet, there's no explanation as to why. It's just - here are 5 people and they're all enhanced for some reason.... that will miraculously work to their advantage in the end. I love paranormal stories, but there has to be some reason or explaination or secret government testing or ANYTHING for that matter to explain why there are so many people with abilities.

Other than that, the story is well written to show how Jade is struggling to overcome her limitations because she's an empath. She's a very likable character and the author does a nice job of making you want to root for Jade you succeed.

I'd recommend reading the book, and am hoping the author goes into more detail about why in future novels."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"One word sums up the follow up to The School for Mysteries: A Cozy Paranormal Adventure (Nurse Phoebe Book 2) and that is ""disappointment"". The predecessor was such a fun and exciting read in which the middle aged protagonist goes on a very wild adventure full of page turning thrills such as a heart stopping pursuit by unknown enemies, a murder attempt, etc. Even though that book's ending felt a little abrupt, I was still eagerly anticipating the next book in the series. If the last book fell short in the ending, this follow up more than compensates by having too much filler on the history and descriptions of French castles and its prior inhabitants. It felt as though Ms. Jourdan was promoting French tourism instead of focusing on her characters. The book did not actually pick up pace until the half way mark and even then her nemesis was hardly developed as a character. I absolutely love Phoebe's character and hope that if Ms. Jourdan continues the series that she brings back the exciting energy of the previous book because this one fell flat."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"Leigh develops the world surrounding music well, allowing those without the background to understand whats going on, while also not bogging down those who are already in the know.  The entire world is built in such a manner that you can easily follow the multiple different aspects of this well written novel.  Unfortunately I had a hard time fully getting into the story.

I enjoyed the characters in this novel.  Leigh has developed them in a multifaceted manner, allowing readers to get to know them on many levels.  There were times when I had a bit of difficulty merging them with their counterparts in the first novel of the series.  The major transformations and character shifts were a little drastic, but were also very well & easily explained by the current events surrounding the characters.

Although well written & enjoyable, I simply found this story difficult to fully get into.  I fully understand why others can & will thoroughly enjoy it, it wasn't my cup of tea.

Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"Warning- some spoilers inside:
Not sure what to say about this book- except that I definitely liked the first book in this series better.
Here is my summary of what happened. Every chapter- Amilia falls apart and has an emotional breakdown. (Some authors don't realize that carrying a sword and killing people doesn't make a woman strong). Amilia is lacking the emotional strength that is required to be a real K-A female fantasy protagonist- sorry.
And the plot line- every few chapters we find out the ""real secret badness"" that has been going on- and every time it gets revealed more it changes again! This is confusing for the reader and feels poorly planned. And Grayson also- every chapter he is revealed to be something else and something more important that he was before. One reveal would have been enough. Again- felt forced and confusing.
The book did have some good points. I did make it through to the end and Amilia did gain some independence and strength by the last few scenes. Grayson's love for her is also a highlight of the book.
I'm just not sure whether or not I will read book three."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"Even after thinking on it a while after I finished reading, I still have mixed feelings about this book.  The characters were likable, especially Cade, but there were parts of the story that just didn't work for me.  The main thing was some of the dialogue between Cade and Brook.  I hate to say it, but it was juvenile at times, and very repetitive.

As I said, I liked Cade.  I really felt bad for him, and the way he seemed to be led on my Brook, and just waiting around for her to make a decision that would effect their possible future together.  I did start liking the book more at the end, and was rooting for Cade and Brook to finally get their HEA.

The book was long, and not being completely invested in the story until close to the end, it took me longer than usual to read, so to get to the end and see that there would be another book?  I was pretty disappointed.  I still can't decide if I liked the story enough to want to see what happens next."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"I feel bad because I was so excited for this book, but I just can't give it more than 2 starts.

First we meet Jill Appleton she is a human scientist with a love for bears. She also doesn't get laid enough because she is 6 feet and men are intimidated by her. So she gets grant money to go study some bears in the woods of Virginia for a year.

Then we have King and Rogue. 2 very alpha bears who shouldn't exist but obviously they do. Their clan has had all the women and adult men taken, so King and Rogue are the only 2 left to take care of all the cubs. King is stuck in tradition and believes they will help their clan survive while Rogue goes and does normal human activities when ranging and believes traditions should be in the past.

Needless to say Jill is saved by Rogue and she is marked and is now being told she is a mate. Neither of the males act excited about discovering they now have a mate. The story jumps around and there are holes where I was left thinking ""WTF happened?"""
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"Desire: The Dining Club: Part One is the first short story in an eight part series. Since this is a short story, this review will be brief.

I don't really have much to say about it. The writing isn't awful, but it grows a bit redundant, vocabulary-wise (for example, David says a lot of things quietly).

My main issue is as follows: nothing happens in this first book. It feels like someone took the first chapter of a novel and released it independently. This first part only discusses what the club is, and that Grace is to visit. You don't really learn about the characters much and they come off as cold.

This novella gets two stars based on the concept. I'd very much like to see how this goes. However, I'm not going to collect pieces of eight like it's some kind of literary trading card. I'd rather just wait until they're all out and read them as one full length book than sit through snippets like this. I'd very much recommend that other readers do the same.

Thanks to Netgalley and Forever (Grand Central Publishing) for my copy in exchange for an honest review."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"Argh, this book is very frustrating. It's sort of like reading a stream of consciousness with, lots of quick random changes of topic. Sort of like giving a character an accent it's sorta interesting, but it got old quickly.

It's also a thriller, and it uses a bunch of cheap tricks to achieve that. Every other page is some new dangerous life or death situation. Despite all the talk of how competent the characters are they are still thrown from one random situation to another, really they are just along for the ride their choices don't seem to matter, the author will dues ex machina as needed to keep people alive and to keep the suspense and urgency going. Also he's really light on the backstory, constantly hinting at it with characters literally saying ""ill explain everything later"" but they never do.

Frustratingly I think the setting of the book is fairly interesting, sort of a shadow run setting, except more post apocalyptic and heavier on the brain hacking/AI side. Unfortunately it being the sort of thriller it is , it doesn't really build a coherent world, you're just left with a bunch of impressions with no predictive power."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"At the very beginning of the book, you get this (way too long) introduction by Randi Fang. Since the name of the character and the writer are the same, at first I thought it was the authors introduction, but it seemed like the story, so I read on. And it's a good thing too, because it was the actual story.

Then after page after page of intro, finally came the interview. But before the interview could get started, there was yet more of the unnecessary yakking, where our interviewee sat at the table texting her heart out while Miss Fang ranted and raved about how attractive this vampire was.

Now the story finally gets started, and it was exactly what I had expected, but it was quick. Of course, we know by this point, the relationship will not advance, so it was no hardship when you never find out what happens next, the interview is simply over.
Then some more dribble about how Miss Fang thinks this Vamp-chick is super hot, and we're done.

I liked it, once the story got going, but I am not motivated to read more books because it seemed that there were a lot of wasted pages."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"This is a quick, heated historical read about a young woman being pressured to marry the right man and a man with no title and no fortune who also happens to love her. Its short, sweet and has sexy moments, but there really isn't much more to it than that. Both characters have appeared briefly in the rest of the series and to be honest I didn't really learn much more about them in this book. Paul is quiet and honorable, Georgina feels trapped by the rules imposed on her and does her best to flout them where she can  which contradicts her previous behavior, where shes been much more prim and proper. If you're looking for a quick read with some Regency flair  including a fun historical outing to see Madame Tussaud's waxworks  and like a bit of sensual heat, then this will likely fit the bill. Certain things were resolved a little too easily for my liking, but that might have been thanks to the short length. Overall its a nice read that unites a couple of minor characters from the series.

Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"genre: paranormal romance
setting: contemporary
format: collection of short stories

The author's book description is so far off as to be false advertising. This is NOT a novel. This is a collection of short stories. I only read the first. If the author doesn't take the time to describe the ""freebie"" stories, I conclude the quality is too low to be worth my time. The first story supports this.

""Bearly Mended"" shows potential. He & she meet when she (a doctor) treats his wounds. What I liked best is the universe, which shows potential. The leading man's personality & behavior was well crafted. The grammar was pretty good, which is above most self published stories.

Alas, the problems are numerous. The plot is fragmented. The doctor's behavior is so unprofessional (what employer would put up with an employee just leaving mid-shift without notice?) and unrealistic (how did this doctor get avoid working in an emergency room as part of her training?) that she would be fired immediately. The lack of police involvement cannot be justified in a society where shifters are known citizens. The transition between chapters can be rough, sometimes feeling like the author accidentally erased a few chapters.

I don't do ARC reviews."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"I liked this book but I didn't love it! I had some issues with Allie. To me a lot of the time she came across as self-centered, snobby and judgmental! I also hated how she would say ""my half brother"" all the time, I get that we need to know that, but if we are to believe she loves and cares for her brother Darius and they are close, by the author always using half brother instead of brother its not believable, they ARE blood, it shouldn't matter that they have different fathers.
I really liked Micah! I didn't think his secrets were all that bad. Although he has money, he is very giving to those he cares about and he gives a lot to charity. For me Micah made the book!
Another big problem for me was, that Allie and Micah NEVER said I LOVE YOU!!! Only at the very end, did Micah say ""this is love"" and all Allie did was smile and nod!! I've never read a book before where the main characters didn't say ""I love you"" at some point in the book. I found this to be very odd!!
I will however read Darius and Taylor's story."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"Sending a shout out to the author-Julie Bailes.  Thank you for the gift of your book.  I told you I'd review and here I am.  Just got done with this book.  What a rollercoaster ride of emotions?!  Ali, the lead female, has endured heartbreaking loss multiple times and yet she endures.  Blake has been her devoted ally for years and is determined to help her heal.  While I enjoyed the book, it seemed a bit hard for me to get into.  I realize all the reasons for how the book is laid out considering the ending... but it seemed to be drawn out and sometimes slow. The ending was a cliff hanger and ended rather unexpectedly.  Still Ms. Bailes is a fine author.  Her story flows, there are no spelling or grammar errors which makes the story easy to follow.  It seemed to take awhile to really get to the heart of the book but once I did, I found myself eagerly following along, cheering for Ali and Blake.  Give Shattered and Shaken a chance.  I'll be looking to add the next parts of this series to my collection."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"I was given a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.

I really wanted to like this book. I thought it was a great premise and that the author was very creative in her world building. This is a book about triplets who are separated from each other at birth. On their 15th birthday their father brings them together and shares that they have a destiny together to save the world from evil.
Rise of the Trinity started out really well and had a great part in the middle, but overall it left me disappointed. There were several grammatical errors and typos. The wrong names in the wrong place, of instead of or, and similar mistakes. I found the timeline to be very confusing. When the book starts the characters are all teenagers. Midway through the book they have their 15th birthday. At times the reader is told in the narrative that years have passed, but the action would not indicate this. It might be helpful to mark the changing of time for the readers so that they are not trying to put the pieces together.
I think this could be a really great book I just think it needs a little polishing"
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"*** 3.5 stars ***

 I don't know how I feel about this book. Don't get me wrong it was good - what I read of it anyway. I had to stop reading because for some unknown reason it made me sad. I knew something bad was going to happen. The sense of foreboding was overwhelming and I just couldn't take it. I stopped reading a chapter 17 and skimmed through the rest and of course something bad happened. I wasn't so upset about the kidnapping. I was far more upset about what happened between Juliette and Killian. It was heartbreaking. I literally felt the pain of it and I wasn't even reading the whole thing. However I found myself going back to what I skipped over and reading it. The grand finale at the end wasn't so great. It should have been more elaborate. That epilogue was meh. I was expecting more. It could have been an awesome book if there was more happiness. They were happy times but it didn't feel genuine because it had a looming darkness that overshadowed it. I don't know maybe it's just me. It wasn't bad but it wasn't great either. I hope the next book is better."

Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"Daisy's friend, Chloe, invited her to her book launch party. Since Chloe's book is based on Daisy of course she goes to the party. Too bad the party was a bust. There weren't many people attending but the ones that did go sure made it a memorable night.

Chloe's publisher, Hank Hammond, argued with several employees that evening and his wife found out that he had TWO mistresses! When he was later found dead there were so many suspects it was going to take the police a long time to find the murderer. Daisy couldn't let her friend, Chloe, be declared guilty so she decided to find out who the real killer was. Detective Stern was handling the case but he wasn't happy about Daisy's interference in the investigation.

I have always liked the Daisy McDare books and the way she solves the crimes. They are well written, light mysteries that are fun to read. Unlike some other reviewers, this wasn't my favourite. I thought it was slow starting with the first 20% or so giving information about Daisy that wasn't necessary. In general, this book wasn't as interesting as the others in this series.

I found the mystery interesting but the rest of the story was hard to take. First, the police were far to generous with sharing information with the amateur sleuth, second the sleezy behaviour of the friend left a bad taste in my mouth and was just left with no resolution and third, the murderer wanted to kill Laila, but all he does is tell her to give up her snooping? Not strong writing in my book. It was okay, but I probably will not go out of my way to read another in this series."

This is were Elizabeth forms a plan to sell her virginity to the highest bidder. This is also were the excitement begins. There are so many levels to this book. It is part romance, erotica, mystery, and suspense.

This was a well written book with a great story line. I loved that it ended and it wasn't a cliffhanger. I do wish that there were more parts with Hunter and Elizabeth together and a little less of the Priscilla parts."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"A mysterious letter, a family secret and a sense of wanderlust leads Keelin to leave her life in Boston to travel to a small coastal town in Ireland. It's there where she finds the truth behind her gift and a sense of belonging she's never known before.

This book is rather sweet. But also infuriating at times. The author goes to lengths to show just how highly educated and wonderful Keelin is but she manages to do some fairly stupid things whilst in Ireland.

I liked the mixture of modern day life with the ancient magic which surrounds Keelin and her family. Keelin's romance with the man next door was rather hot with their chemistry being intense but they were a couple I wanted to know more about outside of their sexual compatibility.

Wild Irish Heart is an enjoyable romance story with a gorgeous setting. The characters were a little flat but considering this story was less than two hundred pages, I think there was probably just wasn't enough time to get to know them as much as I would have liked. I probably would continue this series because I found myself liking some of the secondary characters (who's book is next in the series) slightly more than I liked Keelin and her beau."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"This book is typical of the genre and is filled with angst, smoking hot scenes and complete and utter denial and misunderstandings. It covers all of the bases that fans have come to expect. Two people who are complete opposites find themselves attracted to each other but have a million reasons why they can't be together.

This is the first book in the Lost Boys series and it is safe to say that Devlin is a little lost and a whole lot bad. Sometimes I find myself really getting behind this kind of character but there was something about Devlin that was holding me back. I didn't love him as much as I would have liked and I found that a little disappointing. It is hard to pinpoint what exactly was off but it was definitely something. Perhaps it was some of his questionable moves. I'm not sure. He just didn't seem as sincere in regards to Rena as I would have liked. Rena was also a little on the weak side for my liking as well. Their relationship lacked the depth that I was craving.

Although I did find the characters a tiny bit weak it was still an entertaining and easy book to read. I think there is promise for future instalments of this series."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"Overall, this is a cheesy, predictable, but cute little romance/chick lit.

It's one of those books where the reader can figure out the general plot within a few pages. There are no surprises here! That said, other than the main character's total inability to figure out her flatmate's motives, these are likeable characters (Josh is practically saintly, which stretches suspension of belief to an extreme) and it's a fun, if rather far-fetched, plot.

However, it could so easily have been a good deal better. Romantic comedies, be they in films or books, are generally thoroughly predictable, but there's foreshadowing and then there's LOOK THIS IS WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. A touch more subtlety would not have gone amiss! It is at least fairly short, or the plot would get even more contrived.

On top of that, it needs a good proofread to weed out the careless mistakes. Lots of capitalisation of speech tags, words missing out, misused/typo'd words (were for wear, for example), etc. Generally I don't expect perfection from self-pubbed efforts, but I do expect the writer to take a little more time to fix basic, easily corrected errors like this.

So... reasonably engaging characters, and the book is entertaining enough (with at least one laugh-out-loud moment), but if I'd paid list price for it, I'd feel pretty short-changed."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"This is one of those marriages of convenience, a trope I often like.  The hero is turned off women, resenting his mother and all the shallow, greedy women of the ton she tries to marry him off to.  The heroine is distrustful of men because of having the most horrendous, abusive father you could ever imagine.  A father who's arranging her marriage to an older ship captain and white slaver, who equals or surpasses the father in horrendous behavior.

She runs away from home to escape marriage and he runs away from London, basically for the same reason, except in his case he wasn't really in any desperate situation.

Well, you know what will happen by reading the blurb but not exactly all the particulars, some of which are fun and interesting.  No real unicorn here, of course, but the symbolism plays a part in the story.  There are also some entertaining secondary characters, although nobody is drawn with much dimension.

However, this is not Chater's best work.  I did not like the hero much. Too immature, too erratically friendly and then cold and almost mean to the heroine.  Still, the writing is good.  Chater knows her way around words and sentences, but I have to like the hero in my romance to be completely satisfied."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"In Love on my Mind, Chelsea is hired by Adam's company to help him get ready for their new product launch.  If she does well, there is a big promotion in store for her. She faces two big obstacles...Adam is a genius, but socially awkward and she can't tell him she has been hired to help him.  This book is Ms. Livesay's debut with Avon Impulse and I think they have found a promising author.

I definitely enjoyed this book.  It's a sweet story about accepting those we love for who they are and seeing the potential in them.  Chelsea and Adam were a cute couple.  I loved Adam and his inability to lie.  He is a genius with a form of Aspergers that makes him very literal. It was actually kind of refreshing and made him more vulnerable.  Chelsea grew up in poverty and sees her success as a way to prove she is better than her adolescent life. She has some lessons to learn about what is really important.  I would definitely recommend this one. It's a cute story and I look forward to more from this author,  I hope Mike, Jonathon and Indi get their own stories!

Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"Archangel Zach is a quick paranormal read that I found to be interesting and enjoyable.  The plot is solid and the writing is strong and descriptive.  The author has created an engaging world where there are human angels on earth with special powers as well as the Archangels from the Angelic Realm.  These are not supposed to mix in a relationship, but you know what happens when something's forbidden...

Zach's character is tormented and has never gotten past losing his love over three hundred years ago.  It is easy to empathize with him, and to understand why he keeps Shasa at arms length.  I did have a difficult time seeing the two of them together, for some reason they just did not click for me...I just didn't feel that spark between them, I'm not sure exactly why.

The story itself moves well, the second half quicker than the first mostly due to the action and drama that is occurring at that point.  I was able to read this in less than a day, and found the story easy to follow even though I haven't read anything else from this series yet.

If you're a fan of angel books, especially when they mix with humans, this is a good story for you.  Recommended for 18+ due to some language and adult sexual scenes."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"This book was raw with emotion from page 1 and starts from after that awful day that changed Diana from the carefree person she was to a person who struggles daily with demons.  You can not help but to feel for Diana, wishing that she would get better.  Gideon was an amazing character even with all of his own demons he fought the hardest for Diana.

We follow Diana on her struggle to get past the fact that she was raped.  She always believed that if anything bad was about to happen that the hero would swoop in and save you.  She had a hero with her, Gideon, did what he could to save her but on that day it was not enough in the physical sense.

As Diana fights to become a person again, Gideon is there every step of the way.  Even though there are more steps back than forward it seems.  He is also trying to deal with the fact that he was unable to save her.  Although his words to her that day did save a small piece of herself, she just needs to find the rest of the pieces to be whole again.

Gideon and Dianas relationship continues to grow, helps both of them heal with the aftermath of that day.  In the end they both were each others saviors."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"A standalone read with a HEA, no cliffhanger.  Denton works for his father as an enforcer on collecting money owed.  He also is a CEO of his own business.  He helped out a friend, Kara, by hiring her to be his PA.  Kara is killed and he is hellbent on getting revenge on her killer(s), whoever they are.

Chloe is a newly graduated FBI agent working her first undercover case.  She comes in as a replacement for Kara as Denton's PA.  She is all for bringing Denton and his father down and arresting them, especially since her father was on the bad side of a loan shark.

What Chloe didn't count on was falling for Denton.  Denton doesn't want to fall for Chloe but he does as well.

Overall I really enjoyed the story, but when Denton finds out the Chloe was an FBI agent and was set on bringing him down, I found it almost hard to believe that he forgave her that easily.  I mean he beat up his friend on his father's orders but forgave Chloe for being an FBI agent almost immediately.  Liked the little plot twist towards the end (no spoilers).

I would recommend this as a quick read.  The characters were thought out and the story flowed well.

Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"So this is a series novel....not a big fan of those. Since this book is the start of the series, you would think that the author would have taken her time setting the story up. When the H and h meet for the first time the chemistry is instantaneous. I'm okay with because sometimes in life you meet a person and that can happen. HOWEVER, to have these two meet have sex and then decide they are in love? I'm calling straight BS on that. And what man wants to dive head first into some woman's drama because she's so beautiful and he just has to have her in his life?  And here we go once again with the black woman always having green eyes ,hazel eyes, light brown eyes,etc. Why not just beautiful brown eyes? I'm being petty sorry. Anyway the story although good moves along way too fast for me. They meet..she introduces him to her drama...he protects...they have sex...her life gets threatened again...there's a big dramatic scene with the villain H saves the day... this time they have unprotected sex...then proposes like a week later or three months later...either way. Too soon. I like it when a relationship gets to marinate the characters get to know each other the chemistry and suspense build up so that we can genuinely be excited when the two main characters come together...none of that happened here."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"I read this book all of the way through. He explains a lot of things about quantum physics and other related subjects thoroughly. In fact, it was the most concise explanation for the new scientific discoveries that I have read in one book. But where the author goes wrong, in my opinion, is when he acts as though the Law of Attraction and its related theories work to make you wealthy. He says that all you have to do is have positive thinking and you will attract wealth and other great things into your life. The reason why I have singled out wealth is because he does. He believes that you can become a millionaire and even a billionaire if you use the Law of Attraction correctly.

After talking and talking about his concepts I jumped ahead to the author's story. I wanted to see what the Law of Attraction had brought into his life. He said he was doing well with his software company but he lost everything. Immediately after losing everything he wrote this book. I had to laugh! What better proof that the author didn't know what he was talking about can be inferred by his situation? Naturally, if his concepts worked he would be a successful billionaire by now! If you want to read about the recent revelations about quantum physics this is an excellent book to read. Other than that, at least it was free."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"First of all if you are looking for a clean recency novel, pass this one up. 2nd although I really liked the plot, it was lost in the morass of passionate kissing and longing for one another that began about half way through. Now none of this was explicit at this point, just distracting talk of passion and desires. But it was constant on and off between the plot, so the desire and passion overtook the nice laid out plot already in place. 3rd at the end not too surprising the hero and heroine could not wait to have sex, before they got married, and they did this in the hero's house with his mother and sister there. He said his mother would be happy to see her in the morning at breakfast...  REALLY! This is regency era, no mom is happy to wake up and find out your son had his girlfriend come over in the middle of the night to sleep with him and then have breakfast with the family. BTW, before sleeping together he did propose at least. I can't tell you exactly how explicit the love scene was, as I glanced at it only enough to skip the pages to the ending. I was disappointed.
The plot really had a lot of potential, the story would have been better had it focused on the plot and kept the romance clean and simple. Less is usually more."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"3.5 Short review. It took a couple of chapters before I really got into and started to enjoy the story. Juno is living a dull life that is until the ghost of her mother shows up and starts to liven her life up which takes Juno down the path of reevaluating her life and wondering is she really living or has she been playing it safe this entire time. **Spoilers** There were so many times I wanted to shake some sense into Juno and point out all things she was ignoring about her life, like 1) being that her and her fiance Evan and her are better off as friends than a couple, 2) that her ""best friend"" is in love with Evan and that's why she never takes her side whenever they discuss what's going on in her relationship with him. 3) That her so call friend/co-worker is desperately trying to ride her back up the ladder instead of climbing up it himself, 4) that she doesn't want to climb up the ladder because she doesn't like her job, 5) that her and her neighbor from across the hall have sizzling sexual chemistry that you can start a fire with unlike her dull and routine relationship with Evan. *End of spoilers* Good book just wish it had more ghost interaction between her and her mother, would love a second book of Juno meeting Ryder's family and her seeing more ghosts."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"If you are looking for a quick romantic fix this novella length book might be your answer.  Josh and Mindy are easy to like and they will have you rooting for them after just a few pages.  Mindy is going through a rough patch and what better than a handsome man from her past showing up stranded and looking so fine, to take her mind off her problems?

You could literally feel the tension in this book.  It grew to exploding.

I think my favorite scene may have been the cookie frosting scene.  :)

I loved the happily ever after ending.  It ended just how it was supposed to to make my world happy.

I first picked this book up because Entangled started this Bliss line and it was pretty clean as far as romances go.  I don't know what's happened but for me, a lot of the Bliss line books have crossed over and include scenes that are definitely not clean in my opinion.  And yes, I realize this is a very subjective topic.  I'm just giving my opinion on the matter.  In this book there are sexual situations, the outright sex is not described, but things leading up to it are.  If you don't mind that, this might be the book for you.  However, if you are looking for a ""clean"" romance, this is probably not the book for you.  There is also some swearing."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"While the first Dark Screams volume was a wild mixture of stories without a recognizable common theme, this second collection seems better tuned. It presents stories of dark things lurking in completely unobtrusive places. A swimming pool, walls in a house, or even a wardrobe - suddenly they reveal a hidden evil which bereaves them of their inconspiciousness.

The Deep End (Robert McCammon)
Very straightforward and uncomplicated. My only criticism would be the unnecessary 'epilogue'. I guess this one is my favorite. 4 stars.

Interval (Norman Prentiss)
The first part really gave me the creeps because of its realistic subject. Unfortunately, the author added some supernatural element which didn't work out for me, but add confusion to an otherwise great story. 3 stars

If These Walls Could Talk (Shawntelle Madison)
Nice one with an unexpected twist that caught me by surprise and made me shudder. I loved the detail with the fox eye. 4 stars

The Night Hider (Graham Masterton)
Great reference to the author C.S. Lewis, though I would have preferred something more fantastic in the line of his work. The ending was not as climactic as expected and Jerry's sacrifice seemed unnecessary. 4 stars

Whatever (Richard Matheson)
A collection of song lyrics, interview snippets and articles, loosely connected into a story about a rockband. Dragged on and on without getting anywhere. Sorry, this was not my cup of tea. 1 star

A nice collection with some great authors, perfect to pass some time.

Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"The book description basically tells you everything that you need to know about the plot.

The writing is good, it kept me interested and I constantly found myself laughing at Katy and also thinking what a little idiot she was.  She takes defiance almost to the point of ridiculousness, without regard for her safety - or Cal's.  In fact she's pretty lucky that she doesn't end up raped or killed at more than one point in her life.

I don't really know if you could call this a romance though... there doesn't seem to be a whole lot of romantic feelings between the characters.  Affection and sexual attraction, sure, but it almost seems as though the main reason for their marriage is just that Katy doesn't want to go back home to her mother and step-father.  Not that she has a really good reason for that other than being upset that her father was replaced so quickly by a new man - and forget the fact that her mother probably NEEDED a man to help her run their large ranch (something that Cal points out that makes Katy feel bad for about 2.5 seconds).

But the spankings are well deserved and kinda fun, the plot is fairly enjoyable and there writing is well done.  The best part about the book, in my opinion, are Cal's telegrams to Katy's mother.  Seriously... made me laugh almost every time.  And not because he was being intentionally funny."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"I received The Skeleton Garden from Netgalley, Alibi, and the Chatterbox program in exchange for an honest review.

The Skeleton Garden is the 4th book in a series about a gardener who seems to have bad things, i.e. bodies, turning up around her. And in this book there are actually a few. Pru, the main character is a gardener working with her older brother on the large garden of an English home, when they start digging up the yard to find out why a tree didn't grow, they come across a WWII plane and a skeleton. Not much later in the same hole another body appears and the town is excited to find out who committed the crime or if it was an accident.

This book had a very slow start, I have not read the first books in the series, so I really didn't have enough background about the characters to really feel for them - and even through the book, didn't really feel for them either. So it was hard to read. Yes the book picked up when the bodies started appearing and the investigations started but overall I was not feeling it.

I love a good mystery and this book did provide a few, which was nice, but not having connected with the characters I felt that something was missing for me. But like I said if you read the other books in the series, that may add to the connection with the characters that I did not have."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"Usually i get on an author about not being descriptive enough, this is one of the few that i wish he'd shut up. Here's a quick example.

""There was a flurry of movement in the shadows and the boy darted out quick as a thought. He took three paces at a dead run and stopped, stretched out his arms and breathed deeply of the wonderful air, his chest puffing out like a sparrow's, and he grinned a grin that spread from ear to ear. He stood there with his breath held letting the sun, that ancient and inexorable skygod, still only just begun his day's journey smile its primordial light upon him, warming him.""

That's not even the whole paragraph, but that only three sentences, THREE! I got 4% into this book before i couldn't take anymore. The author seems to feel the need to explain or describe EVERYTHING with excruciating detail.

Some may enjoy this brand of writing, but if the rest of the book is anything like this (no reason to think its not going by other reviews) then i am all too happy that stopped. I gave it 2 stars even though i couldn't bring myself to finish it because, again, some may like it and i'm willing to give it the benefit of the doubt.

I haven't read the sample but i suggest you do, if you cant handle a book reading like i posted above, then i cant recommend this book and you should give it a pass."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"Overall - 2.5 stars
You can have the werewolf and eat the cheesecake too. This is a BBW paranormal romance with all the usual elements.

Fantasy World - 2 stars
The world is a bit ragged around the edges, and you'll definitely need to suspend disbelief to enjoy the story.

Tingle - 3 stars
A hot, naked man shows up on the doorstep, and wants to get busy. What's not to like? The sheik scene is more odd than hot though.

Characters - 3 stars
Full of hot, Alpha werewolf stereotypes. Carole's self-esteem issues become tiresome, and I desperately wanted her to get a clue.

Story - 2 stars
The plot is a well worn path. Nothing new, but it's still fun to take a stroll down it.

Summary
When Carol Anne goes to claim a surprise inheritance from her dead Uncle, she doesn't know it includes a sexy man showing up on her doorstep to provide erotic delights. She's trying to recover from her divorce, and plans to live alone in the country. Unfortunately, Carol Anne doesn't know she's actually close to a hidden werewolf town, and is smack in the middle of a fight between werewolves and panthers.

My Wolf King by Rose Wynters is a fairly standard paranormal romance with familiar elements. It's not going to rock your world, but is more like snuggling into your favorite sweats with a side of cocoa and cookies. You get to visit with hot men who know their mates at once, and a real sized woman who is valued for being more than a twig."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"As you all know, when Im reviewing a book Im big on storyline, character development and connection not only between the characters, but connecting with the book as well.

As far as sexual chemistry, Sky and Ford had it in spades. Every time they looked at one another they were either undressing each other with their eyes or bumping uglies like Jack rabbits. This book definitely didn't lack in the sex department. You were left with nothing less than pure blissful satisfaction, definitely no problem there.

Though Sky and Ford got off on the wrong foot in the beginning, you were able to see how there could be a connection between them once they started opening up to each other and realized they had quite a bit in common. I felt a bit torn because for me, their connection felt more rushed than natural.

Sadly that is kind of how I felt about Repair Me overall. The storyline was good but too much was happening too fast. Every time I would start to connect with the book and really get into it, another scenario was thrown at me to deal with but there wasn't enough time before the book ended for it to feel natural. Either the book needed to be longer or some of the situations needed to be left out in order for the story to develop naturally and really be able to sink your teeth into the book.

I believe this series has potential and I am curious to see what Jennifer does with book 2"
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"Always looking for something new to read.  When I read the description on this and realized there were additional books by the author Parnell Hall, thought I would read The Baxter Trust to check out the writer's story line.

Sheila Benton; has a trust account that says if she embarasses the family name she will loose her money.  The story opens with Sheila and her boyfriend (who by the way is married) doing drugs.  He leaves to discuss divorce settlements with his wife and Sheila just knows that she will not be able to do without the drugs while he is gone. Meanwhile checking the mail she finds a threatening letter.

Lying to her Uncle who monitors her money, gives her $100 ....off to buy her drugs and returning to her apartment she finds a dead body in her living room.  Panic of course sets in as she is in possesion of drugs. so the story takes off.  Shelia doesn't want her Uncle to control her life so looks in the yellow pages for lawyers and finds Steve Winslow, an actor who graduated from law school but had never practiced law.

The story at times is funny, this lawyer who has never even been in a court room in a high profile trial.  Well many twists and turns, then a side story about finding out who is Shelia's father.  Without telling the end of the story and trial, the search for Shelia;s father is unclear ....would I read another book, yes probably."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"Veiled by L. Chapman is a story about losing the one you love and finding someone when you least expect it. Jenny is put through more than one could imagine as she begins to feel her pending nuptials are in danger of panning out. Her fianc, Rich, has become withdrawn in their relationship. Feeling lost and in need of a girls night, she meets a handsome stranger in a bar. Warren turns out to be the spark she was missing in her life.

Much to Jenny's surprise, she finds her husband with another man. He is honest with her and explains the possibility of a health risk. The two are not on speaking terms thanks to this shocking revelation. After tests and full disclosure to Warren, they continue to get closer with their feelings. Knowing her whole world is changing right before her eyes, Jenny decides to move on the best she can and let things take their rightful course.

Veiled ends one happy ending and gives hope to finding a new one. The plot moves quickly as it seems a black cloud is following Jenny everywhere she goes. Her share of bad luck surely must be about to end soon. I was happy to see Mark and Megan were still going strong in their relationship. Baby Lucy is cherished and loved by her little family. Unfortunately, it was hinted that there would be upcoming turmoil with Lucy's custody. This book ends with another cliffhanger and we will have to wait to see exactly what pans out in the series."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"First and foremost they claim this is an BBW romance. The author never mentuons that in the book but they do talk about all the time in the gym she spends and how proud she is of her body and her beauty. How he touches her taut abs and toned legs and so on. Yes you can be curvy and fit but I didn't get that from this book. I feel like she is a skinny gym rat. The book itself starts out so boring I  had to force myself to keep reading. It picked up a little at the end but the ""twists"" in the story didn't  intrest me and where kind of sick. Only a handful if males can mate and she was kidnapped after concieving from one night. Then she gets passed around to the brother. They expect her to have sex with him, which she does, and have 20 babies. Then with the upheavals all she is is a vessel. When I read a romance I  do not expect the heroine to have to have sex with different people and be treated like a baby making whore. I am begging anyone reading this review to pass on this book. I don't  know  where all these 5 start reviews came from but they had to have been paid.  Just not a good read to me. I am glad it was on KU or I would  be asking for a refund since it is definitely  not a rereadable book."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"Talk about drama. Forever and Always by E.L. Todd is the sequel to Only for You. Honestly, I didn't care for this book as much as I was hoping. The reader can figure out real quick what is about to happen.

So, before this book, Sean, our hero, has made it to Seattle and has professed his love and apology to Scarlet. Enter a really fast and quick relationship followed by prego ex-girlfriend and a bunch of mess. I wanted to smack the hell out of the main characters. Sean didn't learn anything from the first book. He was still a complete doofus.

Scarlet was even worse. Instead of swallowing her pride, she nearly cost the destruction of her business. Not to mention, when she did swallow her pride, it was for the wrong reason. Sorry, hate to say this, but I didn't care for where it ended. Sure, time passed, but I felt that another book of them growing together versus a little tidbit about six months later, would have been the better choice.

As always with E.L. Todd, the writing isn't bad. It is quick and easy to pull through. Despite my dislike for these characters, I did like her writing enough to finish the book. I also like that Janice made an appearance and that Scarlet did grow a pair for her friend. I still feel Scar could have done something before this book, but I'm glad she did the right thing.

Really, the book wasn't bad, I just didn't care for where it was going where Sean and Scarlet are concerned."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"Ryder is still grieving the wife he loved and lost more than 4 years ago, but finds himself drawn to his best friend Tess in deeper ways; they are in love with each other, but don't want to risk ruining their friendship.

Best bits: Both Tess and Ryder had messed up birth parents, though Ryder was adopted into a loving home when he was 10 and Tess is still dealing with the aftermath of life with her crazy mother. Now, they both dedicate themselves to saving lives as EMTs. They're both good people, and both rather hung up on each other, though only Tess admits it to herself, and neither wants to mess up their friendship by being the first to move them towards romance. Definitely two very similar people, and once Ryder can get past his fear of losing someone he loves, they seem golden.

Issues: Plenty of typos and wrong words, as well as formatting errors with paragraph breaks happening where they shouldn't (especially in conversations, where it got really confusing as to who was talking at times) and not where they should. A handful of places where thoughts or memories really need to be set apart by italics. Not a fan of the ""quotes"" from characters that start each chapter (this time on separate pages before the chapters?). They feel forced and unnecessary. Some inconsistencies, like Tess's childhood first being described as constant movement from state to state as her mom switched boyfriends, but always after that she's described as having a hometown in NH that she was desperate to escape from."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"The Three Laws are:

A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
A robot must obey the orders given to it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Laws.

Although the author didn't state the Laws in the story she did refer to them.  In my opinion if they could break one, why couldn't they break another.  If so, then why did they need the mechanic.

Dunn is a space engineer that that goes from planet to planet for jobs.  He wakes up from hypersleep to handle his latest job, to fix the communications of a planet from which nothing has been heard for over twenty years.

I enjoyed the clear crisp writing, in the style of the early masters.  Up until the end, when I realized that the laws had been broken even though the author implied that the robots couldn't break the laws.  To be specific, the robots should not have been able to allow harm to come to any of the humans.

In addition, as to the last paragraph there was no foreshadowing or any support for what was happening.

So while I would love to read more by this author, I hope that she will stick to the rules she creates in her universe(s), or explain how/why they were broken or by-passed.

While I didn't like the rule breaking, I did like the story.

I recommend this story."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"This was a good story and I really liked the characters but this read more like a really long Prologue rather than an actual full book. The chapters seemed to break in random places as if someone just counted every so many pages and placed a chapter there. There wasn't really a concrete story being told. It's written more like a detailed account of someones life. Like watching a real life family live and writing each conversation and event in detail. I actually really liked that about the book but it had no real ending to it. I looked up what the series is about and it seems that this is a lead in for the 2nd book. I don't know if I liked it enough to buy the rest of the series. I did enjoy it and it has a unique group of characters, rather than the young sexy hearth throb the hero is actually an older  widower in his 50's with adult children and the heroine is a widowed woman in her 30's. I feel like this book is still a little on the premature side. I can't put my finger on it but the book felt lacking to me. I didn't fully understand the characters and their thoughts and feelings. I felt a little disconnected from where they were all coming from. Also the romance seemed rushed in the end and went from no love to instantly in love very quickly with no real lead in or gradual build up. Overall I enjoyed it but I think it still needs developing."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"Whew, this book may be one of the most intense love stories that I have ever read. I enjoy books about the corporate world, especially relationships involving an executive and a lower level employee. In Tracy Wolff's Addicted, CEO Ethan Frost and intern Chloe Girard are madly in love.  Actually, the word madly is an understatement, their love is completely all-consuming, and as a result they are unable to function when they are apart from each other.

After reading the dramatic prologue, I was hooked, at least for a little while. Some of the scenes are repetitive....Chloe running away almost every time she and Ethan have a problem, Ethan waiting for Chloe to come back to him, and Chloe's inability to cope with her past, to name a few. The story is good, what there is of it. A little less sex and a little more plot would have made the book more interesting.

Ethan is a likable character, albeit a bit tortured by his lack of pure common sense. He may be uber smart when it comes to business mergers, but when love is involved, he is downright simple. He does not learn from his mistakes because he makes the same poor choices over and over again. Chloe is an intelligent young woman, however, she is quite immature when it comes to being in a relationship. Chloe's best friend is a real hoot and I would have liked to learn more about her character.

Scorching sex scenes are an integral part of this book and Ms. Wolff does an excellent job of creating passion. Overall, a good read."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"First let me start off and say I hate serial books. Totally hate them. However I did bite at Entwined for two reasons. One, it was free. Second, it was a Tarzan and Jane book. I have always been so intrigued with Tarzan and Jane and I thought there certainly isn't any harm is downloading a freebie from Amazon.

I wasn't disappointed but I also wasn't thrilled either. I would bet if I read this story as a full length novel, I'd have liked it a whole bunch more. One of the reasons I despise serial books is because each book leaves off on a cliffhanger and you are forced to buy the next installment to read on. I really really reallllly hate that. It is such a turn off for me. I'd rather have spent $5 and got the entire book than a grabby grab for a continuous purchases. Oh well, I knew that going in so I shouldn't really complain. Good on the author for letting it been known in the book blurb that it is a serial book before you buy.

The writing was really good. Great descriptions. Easy to follow and even though it was a novella, I got to know the characters pretty fast. Since it is an erotic novella, there are a few great steamy scenes. Of course you have to read further into the series to get the smoking steamy scenes.

Couldn't go wrong for a free purchase but the carrot that was dangled in front of my face at the end did not entice me to move on to the next book."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"It was so freaking long! There was just too much detail and I really didn't need to know every move they made every day. Very flowery, sappy dialogue was used a lot. I disliked Chase's prejudiced generalization that bisexual men are predisposed to cheat because they are attracted to both sexes. Cheaters are predisposed to cheat and it has nothing to do with sexuality. And he had that viewpoint prior to the boyfriend that cheated with a woman.

I also disliked the fact that Gray spent 10 years with Devon and dismissed it all so casually. Devon should never have cheated and never should have stayed if their relationship was so bad for 4 whole years. Maybe he was as manipulative as he was depicted. But Gray should be blamed as well, when he was the one avoiding intimacy and was too lazy and too complacent to make a clean break. Also, later in the book, he said he owned his house before Devon and Devon only lived there for a year. After 10 years together? That makes no sense.

I know that much of the story was introducing characters for future stories and I liked some of them. I did make it through the whole story but it was a chore. I never connected with the characters. They both seemed immature in many ways. Their little breakup was ridiculous and was no more than a setup for another long sappy make up scene. Added nothing to the book. So I might read the next book because of other characters but only if they're written more cleanly and with less syrupy dialogue."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"I liked the story.  By now you know what the story is about so I won't go into that.  I thought the storyline was good.  I did feel sorry for the Hero who was cheated out of 10 years of his son's life.  He was 2 years older than her and she was a college graduate, so he had to be around 25 or so.  I think in his drunken state he was just popping off more than he really meant the words he said.  I realize to make the story work she had to run.

She did make a lot of dumb choices and she did seem very immature and weak when she was suppose to be such a strong character.  I could almost deal with all of that.  What got on my last nerve, and SPOILER here, was her insecurities.  Good grief, what does a guy have to do to convince you he means what he says.  She did take responsibility for some of her bad choices so I will give her that.  She was rather annoying and not a heroine that inspired a lot of affection.  Seems he was made to grovel and she was the one that ran rather than staying and discussing things with him.  But, this is one of those stories you need to read for yourself.  I found it very interesting and I definitely would recommend it.  I did read some of the low star reviews and I had to agree with a lot of what they said but I did like the story."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"A romantic mystery with a touch of suspense.

An Opportunity Seized caught my attention with its name. I immediately thought that this was a workplace/office mystery. After reading the book I am still not sure what the title has to do with the story.

Toni is an heiress, the daughter of a mining magnate, who just wants to be normal whereas Jason is ex-military and co-owner of Haven Security. Jason is the bodyguard hired by Tonis father.

While guarding her he develops feelings for her. She falls for him, too. A relationship that was almost impossible to begin with is tested when a mining accident threatens the whole family.

One thing I liked about the relationship was that though both of them were immensely attracted to each other, they also get to know each other on a deeper level than just chemistry. This part of their relationship is shown clearly after the mining accident.

Readers who enjoy frequent sex will be pleased with this short story. It wasn't the hard core erotic variety but there is enough to make a reader who isn't used to reading it to possibly become either uncomfortable or start blushing like crazy.

That being said this is still a mystery. I think the beginning was a little slower than the ending. The ending seemed a little fast paced, which I loved.

This is a romantic mystery, heavy on the sexual elements. It worked for me because there was enough of the mystery plot to offset some of the romance.

The ending was a full of surprises. The twists and turns and the new information that were revealed kept me reading to the very end.

Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"Sky High was a short and sweet read but it didn't exactly deliver all that I expected it to.

Some books that I have read make every character seem important no matter how trivial their role was, but this book wasn't one of them. While reading this book, a lot of times I thought that a character wasn't a significant part of the book and this didn't just happen during the book, It also happened after I had finished it. I kept thinking about the book and all of the characters inside it and they just didn't seem important enough even though I know they were.

What Im trying to say here is that, in my opinion, this book lacked some sort of execution or finesse that could have taken it from being just another good book to an amazing one. I never for one second doubt that C.J. Lake holds talent for story writing but all Im saying is that it needs a little bit more work.

Other than that, the story was sweet, romantic and also quite hot. Even though a lot of characters appeared to be minor, I did love the main characters and the chemistry between those two. The relationship between those two was something to envy. Their banter, their romance, their attraction toward one another was extremely enjoyable to read.

In the end, I wouldnt say that reading this book was a waste of my time but I also won't be reading it a second time. Nevertheless, I will be reading other works of C.J. Lake to look for better versions of Sky High. And when I read one like that, let me tell you well have a winner on our hands."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"I have mixed feelings about this book.  At times I loved it; other times I threw it across the room.  The information on writing reviews, Listmania, and So You'd Like To...Guides was extremely valuable.  Knowing how Amazon uses this information to get more exposure for your book is worth the price of the book.

But there were a lot of questions that remained unanswered.  Author Connect was somewhat confusing.  I asked quite a few people to access an author's profile page and no one succeeded. Amazon customers will follow the path of least resistance. If these are so well hidden that Brent has to give you a web address to put in to find it, how are the readers supposed to uncover this ""useful"" information?  They won't.  I understand that isn't the Brent's fault, but why should I spend my time doing something potential buyers can't find, even if it's free!

Buy X Get Y could have been more detailed.  There is more to pairing books than selecting a title.  Is it worthwhile to pair your book with a top selling title that has a one or a two-star review as a Spotlight Review?  What if the title you select is in the top 10 in sales, but sells for 1/2 the price of yours?  Is it a good match?  I don't expect Brent to do all the work, but I do feel these are valid questions that should have been addressed.

If you look at most of the 5 star reviews, you will see that they are nothing more than shameless self-promotions of books written by the reviewers.  That should tell you something."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"Obsession by Jessica Hawkins
Beau did not see the revenge coming but when it happened he was angry and wanted to find Lola.  He wanted to destroy her?  Lola played the final card which not only hurt Beau but herself as well.  While Lola has disappeared, Beau is intent on finding her.  He goes through all the motions of being angry, looking for revenge and ultimately looking at himself and realising the part he played in this game.  How shallow of a man he became because of his money.  He realises that he loves her and not because she turned him down but because she is his equal and she owns his soul.  Lola has hidden under the radar while doing a road trip.  The trip opened her eyes up to discover what her future may hold.  After looking back on everything that they had endured, she knows she still wants him.  With her unexpected news and the realisation that LA is home, she heads home.  Can Beau convince Lola that he wants her without the games?  Can Lola ever forgive him?  I must admit I was a bit disappointed in this book.  The story lacked a building climax and was lacking conflict. Nothing much happened and most of what did made reference to things that we had read in the previous books.  In my opinion, I felt like the author was struggling to conclude this book.  The ending was really a bit of blas and the dialogue was awkward.  The head hopping between the characters was confusing.  I was hoping for more of a dramatic ending.  Overall the series was good but I did feel a bit let down by the ending..

Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"Funny, but I don't recall the other book leaving out this much information, but then again it was this time last year that I was reading it so maybe my memory's not so fresh. This book is good, but one thing that threw me off was the passage of time; there was no indication of it. ""2 weeks later"" ""6 months later"" these are only 3 word phrases, it wouldn't take much to add them. But one minute it was Christmas, then after a separator in the middle of the page - which usually indicates a scene change - it's spring break, then next thing you know it's Thanksgiving. One of the reasons this is a problem is right before the page separator, Adam and JJ were saying they needed to discuss something important, and then after the separator, not only has it been discussed, but the process has been put in motion and they're almost completely done with it. No build-up or anything. This happened several times, which left me scratching my head and wondering ""well, what happened in between?"" I was glad that they were able to help provide a safe place for Thad, but what happened when they went to talk to his parents? Was there no argument or backlash at all? No obstacles in their way? And how did they decide to get legal guardianship? And why was the situation with Andrea helping out Adam and JJ handled like it was no big deal, just every day happenstance? And what happened with Grace Griffin? And this may be minor, but how on Earth did Thad get a new love interest before Adam's brother, Matt? Too many questions. However, these things are not guaranteed to keep me from reading more by this author, because his books have sweet story lines with very little angst."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"I thought I would give this author and series a go with this book.  I have to say I was surprised that my attention was caught from the get go.

It was very interesting to see how Dominic spent the last 200 years buried at sea.  When he was 'resurrected' he was thrown into the future and struggled to catch up.  His friend Palo took him in and began teaching Dom how to survive in the new world he found himself in.

A few thing bugged me about this story.  The grammatical errors.  When Dom accused Palo as a 'trader'.  I think the word should have been 'traitor'.  So little things like that distracted me from the story a bit.

The author glossed over the transition period for Dom.  I felt that the book could have been much more detailed and the author could have had fun with Dom's struggle with the 21st century.  I realise the focus for Dom is revenge, but the writing could have been meatier and richer if the story went into a little more depth.

The sex described seemed to skip a few steps.  I won't go into detail in case there are under 18's reading, but there was no writing direction, the reader has to assume what happens and where the positions of the characters are.  There were instances where I had to re read passages to see if I missed some things.

In the synopsis Dominic is intrigued by a lady biker.  The only lady he showed an interest in was a mechanical bull rider at a bar he nearly got tossed out of!  So I wonder where and whom this lady is , cause I didn't meet her!

But it was a good start and I am definitely curious enough to get the second book!"
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"When Callan Carrigans father leaves the ranch to Court McAllister, Callan is shocked to say the least. For years she had worked alongside her father to keep the ranch running smoothly and it has been her home and her life. She also discovers letters to her and her sisters from her late mother that bring news that change their worlds. While Callan fights to regain some amount of control over her life, Court lends his not only his supportive hands but also makes a proposal that could give Callan some resemblance of her old life.

I absolutely loved the characters, especially that of Callan and her sisters. They share such a cool bond and are really close and understanding. Callan emerges as this strong girl who is used to running a ranch and confident that she can continue to do so on her own after her fathers death. At the same time she has this feminine quality about her that is really attractive. Court on the other hand, at first at least, feels a little bit of an outsider. He is handsome and sexy and understanding. However, I really did not get their relationship. There wasn't much interaction between them, let alone courtship yet they end up in each others arm. For me it was like two strangers professing their love for each other.

The plot had some twists which were a welcome change from the usual romance novels. Courts background and Callans mothers letters provided some additional depth to the book. However, the letters written by Callans mother felt too clinical in nature and lacked the warmth of a mother. The letters read like appointment letters rather than a letter from a mother to her children, especially with the news it delivers, one would expect some emotional words.

C.J Carmichael is one of my favourite romance authors, but this book disappointed me a lot."

But what we do have is a very well-written and engaging story about a young man's experiences as he becomes an intern at a large well-to-do church. In the hands of most writers I would have probably been bored to tears but Mr. Moody creates a fun and entertaining look into the quirks and idiosyncrasies of your standard Baptist style evangelical church. As one who has spent many years in ministry I can say he hit the nail on the head. No matter where you are or what you are doing people are a trip.

If you're the type that likes easy going stories with no stress or books that won't keep you up too late at night I suggest getting yourself a copy.

If you're concerned about the book being preachy because of the topic you have nothing to fear. There is very little Biblical reference at all. It's more about the people and the inner workings of ministry in general. You'll laugh and be entertained. Even non-believers will enjoy this book. It was a nice stressless experience for me and I enjoyed it much more then expected. It'll make a nice seashore read for a lazy vacation.

Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"It was a case of All or Nothing for me. The crux of story sold me even though there were parts I did not like. An aptly named series, Wicked Games play out in this book for Jena. Unwittingly playing a game she has no idea she is a participant in, it appears that by the end of the game she could lose everything. Character and story issues left me with mixed emotions. I liked King, but I did not like his original game plan and I had a hard time reconciling the man who went into the game with eyes wide open to the probable repercussions of what he put in play with the man who fought for his woman at the end. We also got just enough info on King and Wick to know they are not good guys, but not enough to know what exactly it is they do. At times, their actions did not match their words and this disturbed me greatly. Jena came across as dumb as a box of rocks, dismissing what was happening around her by resorting to excuses and sticking her head in the sand. She evoked frustration and sympathy simultaneously, but it was her weakness that lost me in the end. Timeline issues unsettled me as well, as in when did King and Wick meet? Was it in when they were kids or in the military? It cant be both in my head, yet both were stated as facts. A proper back story on those two would have improved this book immensely, probably cleared that issue up and added some character depth that was missing. A little more about Jenas old job would have been nice too. And after all that you're wondering why I said I liked it? It was all about the game for me and on that level it delivered to the point of me wanting Wicks story next. Spices Rating: 3."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"Anyone familiar with the Desire, Oklahoma series will recognize the cast of characters in this story -- including Dillon and Ryder. The newest addition to the town comes in the form of Alison (Ally as affectionately referred to by Ryder). Alison comes to Desire on the heels of a bad breakup from an abusive boyfriend. Similar to all the other stories in the series, Dillon and Ryder come swooping into her life completing ensconcing themselves in it while overwhelming her with their (neanderthalithic) overbearing ways and masculinity.

The story prattled along at a lumbering pace, IMHO, as Alison whined about things being ""none of your (Dillion and Ryder's) business"" (said 14 times) and spanking threats from the men (mentioned 33 times...yes...I counted). The story was highly repetitive...not only of itself but of the other stories in the series. Really the characters in these stories are interchangeable because the story lines are so consistent with one other. This series now has 8 books in it...and honestly, as a reader, I'm getting to the point where I don't care because there is nothing unique about them anymore. Desire for Three: Winning Back Jesse is actually about the characters in Desire for Three. *Scratches my head*....so now we're going back and revisiting characters? Pass!

Don't get me wrong, I enjoy Leah Brooke's work, I just want to see some originality come into play in her stories. As they are now...they are just meh because of near exactness of the stories and characters -- resistant females...dominant men...and they all live happily ever after. I'd like to see her throw some different characters in a the mix. Send someone of a different nationality to Desire to find love. Send a couple looking to add to their triad.......give me something different to work with.

Raw Desire wasn't unenjoyable...I just though it could have been much better and different.

Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"I am assuming that if you are reading this review you have at least read the synopsis of the book and know what the story is about so instead of summarizing I am going to list the things I did and did not like.

The good:

-The characters are great. They are charming and funny and I love that they focus so much on  family obligation

-The authors paint a wonderful picture of small town life

-There is a mixture of humor and more serious things going on within the story.

The not so good:

-There are a lot of spelling and grammar mistakes. A lot of mixed up he/she. There were also times that words were used in an unrealistic way. I don't think any woman has ever thought that she would like to feel a mans cock against her integument, though that is just my opinion.

-There was tons of unnecessary details given. I don't need to know that he turned the shower on, then checked the temp, then got in, then picked out a shampoo, then picked out a body wash and on and on it goes. The story could have been cut in half without losing anything of importance.

-pov jumped around a lot which is usually good but there was no real flow to it.

-There was just too much going on. The focus should have been primarily on Quinn and Mhisery with Chance getting his own book. The little glimpses of other people seemed out of place as well.

-It often felt like rather than reading a story things were being ""explained"" and there was too much repetition and even some inconsistency. He goes down on her at one point and then later is surprised that she is pierced there?

All of these distractions led to me not being able to enjoy the story even though I really wanted to, especially as this book was given to me in exchange for an honest review. I would really like to try another book by these authors though because there were things I really enjoyed."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"I didn't have very high expectations for this book. The combination of teen romance and historical fiction made me nervous that I would be cringing the whole way through. Fortunately, the author did her research and the result is a fairly accurate portrayal of life in a convent in Renaissance Italy, with a splash of magical realism. The romance elements don't really kick in until the halfway mark, leaving most of the book to focus on other aspects of the protagonist's life, what romance there is isn't overbearing or unrealistic. A plot twist 3/4 through helps keep things fresh with an unexpected change of setting for the final act. The book is largely well-written, but there are some poor descriptive techniques scattered about (""as cold as January"" was a particularly bland simile that stuck in my mind).

Where the book disappoints is in the drama. Most elements of the plot had me wondering why these characters care even half as much as they apparently do. The protagonist is a 17-year-old illegitimate daughter of a recently-deceased nobleman who's been sent by her step-mother to live in a convent. This is problematic for our hero because the only thing she wants on this world is to find a man to marry. A more charitable reviewer would say that she's realistically very focused given the options for those in her situation, but her one-track-mind struck me as obsessive and overly dramatic. The aforementioned plot twist is fairly transparent (if you're expecting a twist), and the while the MacGuffin around which the twist is centered may be historically accurate in terms of its importance, it seemed fairly trivial to me and fed into the overall feeling of unnecessary drama.

The protagonist's personal conflicts are sure to resonate with many readers, particularly girls around her age and younger. Readers who have an interest in art, particularly painting, might understand the drama better, and will definitely appreciate the author's descriptions of the art and architecture. The ending could be interpreted as slightly preachy, but it doesn't detract from the book."
Kindle_Store_5,negative,truthful,"(Source: I receieved a digital copy of this book for free on a read-to-review basis. Thanks to author Kris Kreisman.)
Erin is good at tennis, but while she likes it, it doesn't mean everything to her, not the way it does to her mom. Erin's mom is determined that Erin use her talent for tennis, and become something really good, but Erin just wants to have a normal life.

One day whilst visiting her grandmother, Erin finds herself sent back in time to 1970, where she has the chance to play tennis against her mother.
Who will win the match? Is Erin better than her mother? And how will Erin get back to her own time?

This was an okay read, but it felt a little awkward in places.

Erin liked tennis, but not as much as her mother did, and more than anything she wanted to be a normal teenager, and go to the movies with her friends when she wanted to. Erin tried to fit in when she realised that she had travelled back in time, but I expected her to be a lot more concerned with how she was getting back than she was. I personally would have been worried about how I was going to get back, and how soon I would be able to get back rather than making friends in 1970 and taking advantage of how cheap the prices were in the shops!

The storyline was okay, but the time-travel aspect felt a little strange. At the beginning of the story we hear from Erin how annoyed she gets with her mum, and how irritating some boy at school is, and then we're suddenly thrown back in time to 1970. Very sudden, and unexpected, and just didn't fit well with the rest of the story.
The ending was okay, and it was good that Erin learned a little about the sort of person her mom really was. I also liked the fact that Erin's actions in 1970 had consequences, and that her meddling in the past changed things in the present.

Overall; an okay time-travel/coming-of-age story.
5 out of 10."

Books_5,negative,truthful,"I really didn't read anything earth shattering in this book.  I would say save your money, just cut out sugar and flour.  So easy."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"Major fan of Lehane .... However, this was the first book of his I didn't finish. I didn't make it halfway through before I gave up."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"Im a firm believer in a workbook for every kid...I hate worksheets...they are unorganized, they get lost. This is a good basic workbook for social studies."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"Kind of nutty, with some hilarious paragraphs -- potato socks rolling around, making the author gasp.  Book not as helpful as I hoped it would be."
Books_5,negative,truthful,I was intrigued with Robyn's personal journey and growth as a person throughout her trek across Australia.  It was long but glad I finished the book.
Books_5,negative,truthful,Good one time read. The heroine does get verbally trashed a lot by the hero so that was a bit irksome. Looking forward to reading Sera's story.
Books_5,negative,truthful,Steven Hawking is perhaps one of the most misguided pseudo philosophers in the world.....I wish he would stick to physics and leave philosophy to those who understand it.
Books_5,negative,truthful,"The book is fine, but the DVD was not included, so the seller refunded me instead of sending the DVD. I had to go buy a DVD elsewhere."
Books_5,negative,truthful,I can see how other people like this book but for me it was just too much on the dark side and several things about it bothered me.
Books_5,negative,truthful,"A little more depth would be nice. This book, although riveting, is very short. Left me wanting more. Would like to know if his other books are as short."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"The book was a huge disappointment after her ""To Kill a Mockingbird."" It was, I'm sure, hard to top the first one published and so enjoyed by so many."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"some what complicated and very difficult to understand the plot at times, at least the ending was ok. never did understand what really happened to Greys young girl sidekick."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"Let Oberon do all the talking, and kill off Granuaile; One can see her PC stupidity coming from a long way off. She has become a  worthless character."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"Didn't like it as much as the first two. Found the story a little frustrating at times, but if your invested in the series you have to read it."
Books_5,negative,truthful,ONLY reason why I read this was for a college class and I found it confusing even with some background given. I do not like nor do not recommended it.
Books_5,negative,truthful,Not a direct translation of the French. Many recipes in the French version didn't make it in to the English version. I was really looking forward to the entire book.
Books_5,negative,truthful,Good but far from Gladwell's best.  The argument that small is better was a bit of a stretch.  I do appreciate the style and detail that Gladwell offers.
Books_5,negative,truthful,It doesn't cover everything  I had a smaller one that was much better.  It is very big and heavy for an older person who sits in a chair.
Books_5,negative,truthful,This was a story that I could not even TRY to interest myself in. I made it halfway through the book before I threw in the towel. Waste of $5.
Books_5,negative,truthful,"Although Salander singlehandedly can save most series, this one was a stretch.  The characters are shallow, the dialogue is nonexistent, and the story is told, not allowed to develop."
Books_5,negative,truthful,I thought the writing was entertaining and very genuine but not mature enough.  I couldn't wait to finish the book .... I had to scan through the last few pages.
Books_5,negative,truthful,"How I disliked this author, his greed, arrogance and total disrespect for those that provided his living rings all too true. I resent having bought it as it increased his wealth."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"As others have noted, this is an exhaustive study of rabies. At times it feels as if the author googled ""rabies"" and then felt compelled to expound upon each and every one."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"Preggers Jessica
Then there's a zombieland Marc
Is Sinklair the book?

It took me one week
To finish Betsy's sad book
I'm still crying tears

Laura is now bad
I'm tired of the same stuff
Why am I still here?"
Books_5,negative,truthful,Interesting premise which moves fluidly thru place and time but almost too fluidly. The ending feels as if there was a deadline to meet. I give it a 6 out of 10
Books_5,negative,truthful,"i usually love these mysteries,but this one isn't up to snuff..Too much chase and not enough mystery. Although it gave a little more information in relation to the Crawfords as in Beth."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"I have been an avid  fan of Clive Cussler from the very beginning.
Is this book to be taken as an adventure etc....LOL. It feels more like reading for a young adolescent"
Books_5,negative,truthful,"Reminds me of the Karon novels. Does not have a strong plot line. Lots of stories strung together, some for fun and some with a lesson. A nice break from more serious stuff."
Books_5,negative,truthful,I really wanted to like this book because I really liked the characters. It was just really boring and slow moving. This was my first Nora Roberts book and probably my last. Sorry.
Books_5,negative,truthful,Interesting book topic but difficult to read because of lack of cohesiveness in each chapter. I've put the book several times-- I'm usually a fast ready but this book seems to drag on!
Books_5,negative,truthful,"Usually a dependable author, this time I could care less about the characters. A by-the-numbers serial killer fable, with a killer dumber than most, luckier than most. I hope for better the next time."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"Although I love Sue Grafton's novels, I felt this one was not up to her usual standard. The stories were disjointed and the ending was abrupt. Still worth reading but not her strongest story."
Books_5,negative,truthful,It was a good read but not much different than the last few. I was hoping after the first couple chapters the main characters were going to finally create new chapters in their lives.
Books_5,negative,truthful,This book was engaging until the last chapter. It was as if the author wrote the required number of pages and then just quit.  I would not waste my time on this book.
Books_5,negative,truthful,I was hoping for something a little more tabloidish. I'm glad I got to read it for free (Prime member) because I would have been mad if I had paid to read this one.
Books_5,negative,truthful,"The package of Penguin Classics, whose books I find really excellent in content and presentation, is not so good. They do not have any hard protection and the corners always  arrive somewhat damaged."
Books_5,negative,truthful,Very disappointing and not worth what it cost.  Didn't really say anything.  Suggest the authors take their own advice and quit.  Pleasant enough to read for the very short time it occupied.
Books_5,negative,truthful,"Likely my LEAST favorite Daniel Silva -- the main character is going too predictable.  Mr. Silver is an excellent writer, but this novel lacks the quick pace, sharpness, & literary finesse he usually delivers."
Books_5,negative,truthful,I didn't drop 7 pounds (I didn't lose anything and was very diligent) but I did find out that I'm sensitive to my favorite foods.  I've changed my eating habits because of reading this book.
Books_5,negative,truthful,"Too much going on.  Diana is a weak, pathetic female for a lead character. Central relationship is dysfunctional, and borderline abusive, Diana is constantly making excuses for Matthew's horrible behavior.
This book was hard to finish."
Books_5,negative,truthful,Fascinating glimpse into the life of a courtesan.  More than I wanted to know.  Much too long in the early narrative.  Mother daughter dynamics very interesting.  Also Chinese men's attitude s and thinking.
Books_5,negative,truthful,I may have enjoyed it more if it weren't so long.....there were some good and interesting parts to it....but it went on too long...I think like Stephen King...it would make a good movie rather than reading it....
Books_5,negative,truthful,"I'm sorry, but most of the stories in here had little or any connection to science fiction.  Some were good, but should have been included in anthologies of other areas of fiction. Most were just long stories."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"I am reading the books in order and this is the only one so far that I have not really loved.  Not near as good as the others.  Slow, slow beginning and just not very interesting."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"It was good to see the return of SPECTRE, but any reader will be able to pick up on the plot twist because it's so predictable.  Also their is a lot of technical gibberish in this novel."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"Well...I saw where this was going before I'd gotten halfway through the book.  I didn't know all the details on how it would end of course, but it was pretty anticlimactic since I'd guessed the basic plot."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"Some separate stories, but with common elements. I think that I like the other series by Stross more, but maybe I'm just not of the target audience. I still plan to read the other parts of the AA series."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"I'd just finished reading Orphan Train which was a fantastic book. I hurried to buy another book by Kline, but have found this one a bit dull and have now skipped to the end to read the last few pages."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"This tale is very disappointing. Although Le Carr is much touted as an insider to the international intelligence community, his stories can be written by any author that reads the newspapers. Ed Spievack, author of ""Memoirs of an Unfinished Generation."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"This was a waste of money. Boring, repetitive, gaps in plot...I was rolling my eyes most of the way through it. I bought it because I thought it would be just as good as Still Missing, but I was sorely disappointed."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"This information is sold as fact, but in fact all of Sitchins translations have been double checked and proven to be wrong. Too bad I didn't find that out till after buying his books. I wish I could return them all."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"Easy read - for me - but not what I was looking for to use as a Book Club review.  Great message in the overall story, and the characters come alive even in the short story.  I enjoyed it."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"Although it introduces interesting ideas about the interpretation of the Creation account in Genesis, it fails to come to any conclusions and its assumptions are somewhat weak. A thorough argument and comparison to scientific evidence would have made the point stronger."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"You'd be better off working through Competitive Strategy by Michael Porter, there's nothing in here that isn't in Porter's book. This books is a little easier to read for the casual reader however and does have more examples to explain the topics."
Books_5,negative,truthful,This is one of the books Janet Dailey was sued about and finally admitted to plagiarizing. Harper Collins took back all unsold copies at bookstores and promised not to reissue. Being printed by Open Door makes it ok?! Not in my book.
Books_5,negative,truthful,Have a butter knife ready! This is a cute book but I had a bard time opening the slides. I couldn't even grip it and ended up using a butter knife to pry the edge open. Still can't open one off the slides.
Books_5,negative,truthful,"Catchy title. Average book. There are some good points but the delivery is annoying. Keith has a high opinion of himself. This got in the way. I found that I didn't really like him.

I've seen Keith live and again found him too salesy."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"It was an enjoyable read and worth the cost of the book!  The plot was weak to me, but the majority of the characters were carry over from her other books!  Also a little to much techno solutions for quick resolve!"
Books_5,negative,truthful,"Read this for the book of the month literary class at the library.  Lawyer, over achiever, and all round rich kid loses sister.  She claimed to read a book a day in order to handle who overwhelming grief.  You decide."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"I didn't like this book at all. I just don't like this authors writing style and choice of words. No Kristin Hannah and that's for sure! Can't hold a candle to ""The Nightingale."" I should know by now to be Leary of first books."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"I enjoyed this book.  Especially the way the story was told from different viewpoints throughout the story.  There were times when the author would include lengthy sections that had little to do with the story, but otherwise it was an enjoyable mystery."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"Lots of big ideas to chew on in this book, but I wish the multitudes of plot lines and characters would have converged at some point, instead of simply trailing off. One other nitpick ... the author tried too TANJ hard at coining new words."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"Yes, I found this book impossible to put down.  I loved it, and think Ozzy is an insane idiot after reading it.  But, I would love to have dinner with he and his wife now, and I never would have thought that before."
Books_5,negative,truthful,It was like a diary of events in her political career.  I had already heard a lot about Mrs. Thatcher.  It was just a chronicle of events with all the things that she had to experience as a woman in a leadership roll.
Books_5,negative,truthful,I do agree with a lot of the fans in that I felt the he liked the killers & did not want them punished. They should have gotten life without parole Not the sentence he got. And he should have been charged with both deaths.
Books_5,negative,truthful,I'm looking forward to future novels about the young detective. This wasn't so bad. I thought it was too technical especially when it refer to history about sports greats. I would like more mystery in his future novels and less history. But the ending was great.
Books_5,negative,truthful,"This is my first Tana French book and would be willing to try another. At first, I thought that the plot was too far-fetched but then the characters developed and could see that something like this might happen. Some nice details in both characters and setting."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"I feel like i need to go back and read this book again.  I felt it was very repetitive and not applicable to most.  I'd love to be able to quit work, move to the beach and relax.  That's simply not an option."
Books_5,negative,truthful,This book is way too long and confusing. It has too many characters and some characters have similar names which makes it even more confusing. It's neither a mystery or a ghost story like it's been described. I just don't understand how it won  the Booker prize.
Books_5,negative,truthful,"I'm sorry, but this book is a waste.  It has an interesting enough premise, but then it doesn't really go anywhere.  The writing fair and I might well give the author another chance if she comes up with another book, but this certainly isn't a good debut."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"It was OK, less impressive than Lamb or Fool by C Moore. Slow start and not as funny as his other works. Had bits of charm and wit that redeemed it though not enough for me to recommend spending money on it. Worth reading if borrowed from a friend."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"In the tradition of The Handmaids Tale this book talks to what can happen when religiosity runs amok...  I love the foundational premise... the aspects of struggles with faith when suddenly you are one of the sinners...

The book however drags and gets lost in details....

A great book to skim"
Books_5,negative,truthful,"He treats you like you've forgotten it.
I love Ian Douglas' books.
I enjoyed this book.
I look forward to his next book.
He kept retelling his technology and historical expositions.  It bugged me.  A lot.  Hence the 3 stars not 4.
I'd argue he needs a better (or more forceful) editor."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"I will not review this intermittently compelling, but overlong book except to say that it is absolutely the worst place to start reading the Wallender books. Please do NOT read this book unless you have already read several other books in the series and plan to follow the entire arc."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"This is  an enjoyable short story.  Written in 1999,  it is one of the first books to introduce us to the world of Harmony.  I only gave it 3 stars because of its length.  Jayne Castle is an excellent author and I do recommend the book."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"Been a Koontz fan for a long time, but his stories have changed over time.  Breathless could hardly be labeled a thriller, or even suspense.  I like his characters, but this one left me kind of disappointed.  I enjoy when he adds the dogs to his stories, tho."
Books_5,negative,truthful,It's my first SEP novel... but I could not get into it. 1) This guy is just an ass. I mean... ugh... I was trying to give it a chance but when he humiliated her in front of the crowd it was the nail in the coffin... Jackass from start to finish.
Books_5,negative,truthful,"Don't waste your time with this one.  With all the good books out there to be reading there is really no reason to waste your time with this mediocre outing.  The main character is dull, the story is predictable, the plot is weak, and all in all a waste of time."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"Stories were outstanding, especially for a contemporary of that era which I am. Book was in rough condition when received.
badly worn with torn cover but text readable. Probably toss it when finished. First time that a book description did not match the book's condition. Since book was very inexpensive no complaints just facts."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"Oh how this would have benefited from editing to reduce the detail, add more action and lower the page count. I had to take a break after Part Two and read another book before returning to Part Three. I did want to know how it ended but it was a chore to finish."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"It started out really well and peak my imagination right away, but it went on and on about her imaginary boyfriend and just skimmed the surface of her being a witch. I found Jane's relationship with David and Neko more interesting and fun and wanted more of those then all her other ones."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"I thought this book was better than Shopaholic to the Stars because it was a road trip through the beautiful western part of our country. Yes, some of the plots were stupid, especially the Vegas wedding scene. Is it as good as the first few in the series-no; it isn't the worst either."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"I was embarrassed when this book arrived and I realized that I had just purchased a dressed up romance novel. The premise sounded great, but it is only a front. Niffenegger is painfully self indulgent. This would be great as a guilty pleasure for someone who can stomach it, but the write-ups are misleading."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"It is funny, yes and lots of the usual social wit. His use of words and ideas are wonderful and you marvel at his genius but the story is hard to find.  I'll never toss out a Pratchett's book but with this one I'd recommend making long, guiltless hops through sections when needed."
Books_5,negative,truthful,I chose this on a recommendation from a reliable friend. In the beginning I had hope this book would become more likable.  I trudged through to the end.  I could not identify with any of the characters.  I was not sympathetic to any of the main characters.  Don't waste your time.
Books_5,negative,truthful,This book was boring as all get out....from beginning to end BORING...I couldn't take it anymore after chapter 9 I had to skip to chapter 20 and sure enough more ridiculous boring writing...and I'm not sure what others are reading but this book is no way romantic.... it's a tragedy story...true sad but not heart wrenching...
Books_5,negative,truthful,"Granted I'm not really a mystery person and my apology to those who really liked this book but I thought it was choppy, confusing, and not worth finishing. The introduction of new characters was not smooth at all, the segue between Germany and Lisbon had too many gaps. The unfinished tome will sit in my Kindle."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"I found that i got hung up on what i preceived to be a lot of historical inaccuracies rather than enjoy the story. Only to discover that at the end, the author explained all of it in the author notes. It would have been a more enjoyable read had those been at the beginning of the book."
Books_5,negative,truthful,I was so looking forward to this book.  I love the series and couldn't wait for this book to come.  I'm not going to spoil it for those who decide to pay this outrageous price for this book.  This book was seriously lacking from her other novels.  If not just down right boring.
Books_5,negative,truthful,"This is the second book by Patchett that I have read. State of Wonder being the first. The author pulls you in to both books, beautifully written, and both have a very abrupt ending. I have to say I am disappointed once again with her books, she tells some great stories and leaves the reade hanging ."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"I have just started this book and hope I don't have to read too many graphic autopsy reports.  I didn't read The Surgeon but found I didn't have to as this book so far has made numerous references to it.

It seems most of these stories are written by women and always have female M.E.s doing the autopsies?"
Books_5,negative,truthful,"I have all the Honor series and this is the book I like least.  Author seems to have run out of fresh ideas.  In fact, there were parts of the book where I was sure I had read in previous books.  Story line started out good but sort of faded out as the book porgressed"
Books_5,negative,truthful,I enjoyed reading this book as I was learning about some things I knew little about. The relationships and personalities of each sister and their reactions to their mothers hoarding. How the generations kept up the hoarding. The reasons behind the need for this way of life. The difficulties and broken families that result all were presented well.
Books_5,negative,truthful,"I need to separate the story (love DL Sayers) and the presentation.  This book is nowhere close to being presentable as formatted.  Many words or missing and no attempt has been made to edit the kindle edition to fix this issue.  Please, if you're expecting a publish-ready novel to read, DO NOT GET THE KINDLE EDITION."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"sorry, for me this is just getting a bit old and tired...especially with the fact that nearly all of the original characters are either dead, or mostly dead.

really enjoyed the series a great deal, but it appears that vs an ""end""...this is just going to morph into an entire new story with brand new good guys and bad guys."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"Initially interesting and great insights but ends up being one more endless recount of the trashout days. By comparison, Keith Richards' ""Life"" has the breadth, scope and below-the-surface insight that writers should be targeting. I personally lived and drank and drugged my way thru the 60s and 70s. And still enjoy a good tale of those days. But ...."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"Read and enjoyed the first book ""The Breach"" so ordered up the follow-on, Ghost Country.  It proved to be only an OK read, More fantasy than science fiction. Hard to keep track of characters bouncing back and forth in time. Have not decided if I will invest in the third and last book to see how it all ends."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"I could certainly relate to the title character who's plagued by the superficiality of her new life in the ""hip"" suburbs. The author really captures the banal issues, social competition and gossipy habits of people with a little too much money and time on their hands. Fun while I was reading it, but didn't give it a second thought afterwards."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"It fit it's purposes. I needed this textbook for a class, so I bought it. It was filled with a lot of good information I needed for quizzes, lots of interesting information. But at the end of the day, it is a textbook, a necessity for any student taking a class which this book is required. Eh, there you go."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"The author is too eager to tell his story to properly tell you the story that is the reason you bought the book. Before you even start the first chapter of the book, he tells the story of what happened to these men. Then you have to skip every other chapter where the author tells his story of writing this book."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"I do really like Clancy !!!

That being said - I often find my self simply skip 2-5 pages without reading in this book, GOD his tells this story slow and very ""proud of his country"" like. This book is Clancy at his slowest - and that is sad since this is one of his better plots in my opinion. Wasted in all his rhetoric."
Books_5,negative,truthful,Obviously a case of Leigh doing most (if not all of the writing) and riding on the coatails of her husbands name recognition.  I am sure this would not have been published without Davids name.  It is not very sophisticated writing and Polgara is awful immature for someone hundreds of years old.  She acts like a spoiled 16 year old.
Books_5,negative,truthful,"On my way home I detoured 1 block to the library to borrow the book. I OVERPAID! It is one of the 3 worst books I have ever read. The first 100 pages were good, after that it started downhill, reached bottom, and with the ending, started to dig. It was horrible, don't waste your money. Wouldn't give it a star, but had to."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"Another reviewer labeled this book cute. Perfectly described this book. It's like the author wrote down all the awh moments and strung them together and made a book. There is no irony, tension or questions that you don't know the answers to. It is a pleasant read. And I certainly didn't have to put my finger over any word. A predictable chick lit read."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"I received all five books very quickly but my problem is with the books themselves, not the sellers. All five books have the smallest print I have ever seen in a book. Even with reading glasses they are very difficult to read. Just ordered a magnifier to see if that helps. I can't imagine why they would use such small print in any book."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"It's an okay take on a topical issue, but it's not particularly novel. Books on power and change by, for example, Dacher Keltner, John Kotter, and Robert Cialdini have already made many of the key points here. Sure, the examples are fresher (e.g., #MeToo and Trump), but those have also been covered in recent and more focused books that delve deeper into the details."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"UGH! I have never worked so hard to finish a book in my whole life. The base story was great but getting through the first 30% of the book was torture. So much could have been cut out. And even once we got to the good stuff, I found myself skimming whole sections until dialogue picked back up. Dear god this woman needs and editor."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"The works of WEB Griffin are great, I have read all his books numerous times. Trying to market abridged versions of his books is a sham. You cannot take a book normally requiring 11 or 12 CD's and condense it to 3 CD's without loosing 75% of the story line. Poor decision on the publisher's part for producing it and on Amazons part for selling it."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"it was ok for an hour long old time radio presentation. Don't know that I would buy it again, had I to do it over. The packaging was misleading - since Alistair Sim was pictured on the cover; I thought he would play the role of Scrooge. However, Orson Wells takes on the role and the program is really not much like the Alistair Sim movie."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"Have read all eight books and feel these people are a part of my family. I think the author wasted way too much time and detail on fillers in this book though while hurrying over the parts that the reader wanted. I won't spoil it for others by detailing my thoughts. Still glad I read it and will read number 9, if and when it's released."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"I chose this book as we've recently traveled throughout the west. Though I found the storyline interesting, the story itself seemed slow moving. I was not drawn to return to the story and so the reading dragged out. I just don't feel I ever connected with the writer's voice. I am pleased to know that many of the characters were based on actual people of the era."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"This book might be useful for someone just digging into the issues of residential heating and cooling.  It's presentation format doesn't presume the reader has much prior knowledge of the material, which dovetails nicely with the medium-level details of the material.  I consider it a pretty decent overview, but by the time I had read it, other materials I had covered made this book redundant."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"After the other 2 books in the series, I was expecting to be blown away. Unfortunately, I just found these characters to be be really whiney. Especially the hero. Even the love scenes weren't as good as the scenes in the other 2 books. This just wasn't a good way to wrap up the series. I was disappointed. I gave 3 stars because I like the author."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"A wierd story with two completely independent plot lines that are only related because the protagonists know each other. Don't look for it to come together, or for either plot to come to much resolution. They both just kind of peter out. It was like Kava had two ideas that didn't make a book, so she just lumped them together by alternating chapters. A waste of time."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"Its been a while since Ive read a Grisham. And as always, he manages to bring courtroom drama to life. Its the story of a white man who leaves his fortune to his black housekeeper, cutting off his children and grandchildren; the perfect recipe for a lawsuit and a counter lawsuit.

The book starts slowly but the twists and turns are fascinating. I didn't like the abrupt ending though."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"I brought this book to read on a long flight....you know, the type of location where you are trapped and will read ANYthing.  I could not read this disorganized attempt at a story.  I left it on the plane, grateful that I packed not one, but two books to read.
I tried to like this book.
The title and premise intrigued me, but the story was just awful."
Books_5,negative,truthful,I know this is a popular book but it was not right for me. I tried reading this for my book club. I started from the beginning 3 times and could not get into it. Then I skipped ahead about 50 pages to see if it would catch my interest.  It never did.  I am glad I saw the movie but this book was not for me.
Books_5,negative,truthful,"I've never read a Dean Koontz I didn't finish, and that's saying a lot for the author.  I haven't read any further into the series, though I probably will.  I wouldn't call it page-turning.  If you haven't read Koontz before don't start with this.  If you have and you're like me - you just want something you know you'll read - this might be for you."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"I struggled through this book because it was so highly rated; I kept reading because I thought I would eventually figure out what was so special about it.  But I never did.  I despised the drugs, the thought of teenagers wasting their lives getting high, and then they grew up, still relying on drugs to get them through life.
Wish I had spent my time reading a light mystery."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"I have learned a little bit with this book, but she spends far too much time justifying science rather than elucidating it. It comes off quite defensive, and a bit annoying While I am interested in the LHC and have learned a lot about it, it is not why I wanted to buy the book. I am struggling to finish it. While it is well read, I give it a 'meh'."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"I was expecting the Lotr audio book THIS IS NOT THE AUDIOBOOK I have read the Lord of the Rings many times and I have seen the movies many times but I think this might be one of the worst versions of the story, with the irrating voices talking over each other,  the cheesie 70's sound effects. if your a fan and haven't read the book you may enjoy this."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"I can't quite put my finger on it, but I found this book to be a very disappointing read. It was not written in Grisham's usual style, so he's either losing his touch, trying something new, or not paying attention. Whatever it is, the story was convoluted  and difficult to follow and the characters flawed and not well-developed. Skip this one if you're looking for a typical gritty Grisham story."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"If you are expecting a book on the level of previous stories, forget it! Ms Feehan has been WAY too influenced by 50 Shades of Grey. Non-stop sex and domination with very little story. Her recent books have steadily gone downhill into little more than porn with violence toward women. I have loved all her stories in the past but strongly doubt I will ever buy another one. What a shame."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"this book sounded fantastic... it is a short story that would have been best suited for the Readers Digest... the book skips around and seems to ramble.  It is quite a horn tooting for the mother and not much about the actual story.
wish i would have borrowed from the library instead of making the purchase.
just a SO SO book, I couldn't even finshed it after getting more than halfway through."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"An excellent idea poorly developed. What might be the behaviour of a 3,000 yo human being? Would he/she still behave like all of us? I doubt it. I also doubt anyone could survive for so long since the immortals can be killed as easily as ordinary human beings. Let alone any mad guy who would enjoy doing away with them.

The short stories are rather unequal in quality and the whole plot somewhat misfired."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"Words just can't describe how terrible this book is.... I couldn't finish it, I tried, but the scene where the 30 + year old main character decided to bless the 16 year old boy by taking his virginity in a dark, underground seedy sex cave in hopes of undoing the emotional damage that had been done to the boy from his home life, I gave up. I mean, just a REALLY bad book."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"Probably will never happen but this one comes closer than most. The problem is that we still can't shake the hero conceptualization of him.

Personally i think robert creamer's ""Babe"" is the definitive bio on the subject but there is nothing wrong with this book. Just not essential. I wish the author had used the time and effort on a different player who had not been covered enough. His ted williams book is gold.."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"Have always enjoyed very much this authors books, but the ending on this one is a disgrace. Had I known it didn't have an ending, I would not have wasted my money. Not sure I will be buying his books in the future. I would think that he would be more interested in the integrity of his books and not how much more money he can make. Very disappointed , Mr. James Patterson."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"My rating does not reflect the quality of the work but my feelings from it. The dialogue is painfully cynical and Dorian Gray's thoughts and actions are disturbing in how simply evil they are. Everything is overshadowed with the knowledge that this novel was used against its author in real life the way Gray was afraid his portrait would be used against him.

Which version did I read? I've heard some are more complete than others."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"I have had this story for a few months now and I have started it many times. I just can't finish. I don't find the main characters sympathetic enough to what is going on around them...and for the age the main character is stated to be, I find her immature and rude...thus, why I just can't finish the book. I think the basic plot line is solid, but the characterization just fell short for me."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"I had high hopes for this book at the beginning. But, it descended into an endless, circuitous, uninteresting series of events and betrayals. I couldn't wait for it to be over. I did finish it (because I always want to give a book a chance) - but I wish I hadn't. I read it mostly to get a feel for Amsterdam, since we were going to travel there. It was somewhat interesting in that respect."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"I normally like Elizabeth Berg's novels, but this one really aggravated me.  With millions of people struggling to make ends meet, we get to read all about a woman who is wealthy but unhappy, so she takes a road trip to find herself.  She spends money without a thought and she leaves her family behind. I don't like this character. She's a whiny, spoiled woman and who wants to read about someone like this?"
Books_5,negative,truthful,"This historical review of Elisabeth's history as Queen was nowhere near as gripping as her historical novel describing Elizabeth childhood.  Obviously, a real history cannot exhibit the same twists and turns that you can put in a factually-based novel, but this book focused far too much on Elizabeth love life (or lack of it!)  rather than the details of what was a highly political period.  A good read, but not an enthralling one."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"I had heard that Kindle books can be lent. Only a few of them apparently. It is ridiculous that my wife should now have to buy this book again to be able to read it on her device.

If you go to this link, you can learn about lending Kindle books, including how to tell whether it is lendable BEFORE you buy it.

This will dramatically reduce the number of Kindle titles I purchase.

I hope Amazon is reading....."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"If I had known before what I know now, I wouldn't have wasted my money. If I had known that this latest book about the Merry Outlaws was a comedy of errors with the first half a rehash of the other Presidential Series, I wouldn't have purchased the book. If I want comedy, I'll buy comedy. I bought this book because I enjoyed the series. Stick to what you know best because it's not this book."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"This book has few redeeming qualities, and so needs more competition fast to get it out of circulation forever. The information is outdated, the companion website is useless, and the text colors are mustard and navy blue, which make it very difficult to read. Because I also had an uncreative instructor that completely relied on this horrific textbook  for the course that used it, I'm an thoroughly disappointed. There is definitely a market for competition here."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"I am a HUGE fan of the Gamache series but this book is the first where I had to force my self to finish.  The plot and events just didn't flow as well as they had in past books in the series.  The characters in the book didn't like or have the desire to do what they wanted and quite frankly, by extension, neither did I.  Let's hope the magic is back for the next."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"I enjoyed the story, but her books always touch my heart and this one fell a little short. And every time the TV show was mentioned Gut It! was used--very distracting. Also, the name of the show was jarring. I picture ""gutting"" a deer, not a home. HGTV has shows like Generation Renovation, Fixer Upper, Rehab Addict. Ms. Delinsky should have taken her cue from those names. But she still remains one of my favorite authors in this genre."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"Liked the book but wasn't in love with it.  I guess it was because I always had this picture in my head that Phineas was a young immature man and not the typical mature, suave male of previous books.  I love the idea of the older man and Phineas is definitely is not that.  I did like the comedy in the book and his connection with Brynley.  Looking forward to the next book in this series."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"The best thing about this book was it's short. This was so silly and predictable I kept thinking I picked up my 8 year old granddaughters book by mistake. Even the lusty stuff seemed juvenile and silly. Lizzy and Diesel reminded me of Joe and Stephine. They were the same characters with the same dynamics. And what was up with the monkey? The cat didn't really add to the story either, I guess another hampster would be all to familiar."
Books_5,negative,truthful,The author could have gone into more depth about covert bigotry.  THe main character while chastising his son was also guilty of judging based on skin color and religious preference and materialism.  The author should be commended for presenting the bigotry on the part of Muslim's and that it cuts both ways.  Maybe more depth would have been possible if not as much time was spent on the grieving that takes place after you lose your spouse.
Books_5,negative,truthful,"I read the sexiest man alive and thought, nice....a new author.  I bought this based on my good experience and all the good reviews but I have to say Ms James couldn't decide what story she was telling.  Was it John and Rylynn...?  Kyle and Rylynn...Dex? Rae?  Jordon...the father?  Cameron?  There were so many sub plots going on and nothing was satisfying.  Very disappointing.  I'll have a hard time trying another one."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"I would definitely not recommend this J. Grisham book to anyone. I have been a fan of his books for years and this is not up to his usual caliber. It's as if someone else wrote it ( someone who doesn't have anything constructive to say). There is no redeeming social value to the protagonist's actions and if this is what I am to expect from future Grisham novels, then I won't be reading them. K."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"The author documents her sad life of nymphomania while seeking the elusive - joy.
I was expecting an insight to her relationship with Henry Miller during the Paris years.
It post-Paris, the American years, when Miller had gained some fame and notoriety.
He showed up broke, horny and looking for what money she could spare.

I suggest a more accurate title for this book, ""Bored with Copulation"" by Inane Nincompoop.
Don't expect this shoddy diary to enhance your bag of sexual tricks to surprise your lover."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"I had read Syrup and found it an entertaining satire. This one is just a rehash of old themes. It seems like it was written very quickly. The writing lacks sophistication. And one thing really kept bugging me. In America when one's employment is terminated it is referred to commonly as being ""fired."" The author, who is Austrailian keeps referring to it as ""sacked."" A minor detail, admitedly, but an aggravating one that should have been caught in the editing process."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"Really did not enjoy this book.  Which age group/gender of readers wants to hear about the father-of-the-bride lusting over one of the bridesmaids for many years and finally getting to grope her and attempt sex on several occasions, as well as extensive fantasizing about it?  It's the second largest subplot of the book.  Ick.  I would bet that most of the readers purchasing a book about a wedding weekend are women.  They don't want to read this."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"Waste of money. He is a knock off anyway of Dr. D'Adamo's Eat Right for Your Blood Type, except Dr. D'Adamo's books are based more in science and years of experience between him and his father. I only read this because a patient of mine gave it to me. Oh what a waste of time. People, if you are feeling better just think of all the junk you took out of your diet, and of course you are going to feel better!"
Books_5,negative,truthful,"I love Elizabeth Berg's writing. That being said, I did not like this book. Probably because the more I read of George Sand, the less I cared about her. Actually that's not quite right, as by the end of the book, I really detested her. She might have been a brilliant writer, but seemed to me to have the morals of an alley cat, a narcissistic one at that, going from one lover to another. Who cares is she was philosophical about it."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"This book dealt with the serious issue of racial inequality in our country. Hayes touched on many serious instances of this inequality, and provided historical antecedents for their existence. But, he jumped from issue to issue, without a smooth transition between topics. Just when I thought I knew what the focus of the book was, he inserted another issue into the mix. While these issues were seemingly related, I thought the inclusion of so many topics and reflections made for a choppy flow."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"Continuing the saga... this book went slow for me.  It is becoming a little redundant - Jamie does something & gets in trouble, they get separated, Claire has to do/survive something big, they find each other again.  It's like the same thing over and over and over and over again... until the last couple chapters where it got interesting with Geillis. I will continue reading onto the next book, and I'm hoping for a new direction or I'll get too bored to finish them."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"I was so disappointed at the end of this book. Main characters are so blah. No personalities at all. Storyline is confusing and vague. I kept thinking that there would be a twist in the story where everything came together and made sense. It never did happen and I was left thinking...is it me? This book received outrageously good reviews, but the plot was so abstract, that I never made a connection with it at all. Really sad and disappointed. :-(  On to the next book"
Books_5,negative,truthful,"I read 1.5 books in the trilogy.

I don't want to repeat all the justified criticisms concerning historical accuracy and incorrect military policy. What finally ended my reading was the endless repetitive 1,000+/1 battle losses of the axis forces vs. allied forces.

In any confrontation I came to realize there was no suspense involved. At some point in the battle a 21st century weapon would be brought to bear or sabotage would result in an allied victory with minimal losses.

No suspense, preordained outcome, repetitive gory details.

I cannot recommend this series."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"While this is a great book for young readers, especially boys, the plot is taken directly from Shogun.  While the names have been changed, and the main character is now the son of a pilot--instead of the pilot himself, it is a retelling of Clavell's novel.  Don't get me wrong, I like it, I've just read it before.  The books are quick to read, fast paced, but not great literature and not in the same class as harry Potter.  Enjoy them, they are good clean fun."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"I must confess I did not make it all the way through this book. It seemed like too much of a Holly Black ""Modern Faerie Tale"" fan fiction story and not very original at all. Also I was not attached to any of the characters enough to press on. If you read ""Tithe"", ""Valiant"" or ""Ironside"" by Holly Black before reading this book and/or this series you will know what I'm talking about. This is simply published fan fiction. Sadly it's not written badly, I just wish it was more original."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"I've been enjoying the whole Kate Shugak series and will miss reading the books. I was surprised that this series ended the way it did.  Kate has been sort of a wonder woman through the whole series, so the ending of this book just didn't seem consistent.  I know Mutt was a gift from the aunties when Kate returned to the Park but it would have been interesting if Stabenow had provided a sort of history of how the aunties came to be in possession of a wolf/husky puppy."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"My 3 year old daughter and I both love the original ""Best Friends for Frances"" book that we borrowed from the library. We kept borrowing it so many times I thought it made sense to buy it. However, this version is edited to make it simpler for new readers and it loses some of the charm in translation. I highly recommend not getting the ""I can read"" version and just reading the book aloud to your child or waiting until he or she is older and can handle the real thing."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"I read Veritas after reading Hostile Witness and found the author using the same old plot devices that seemed novel in the first - letters/statements from characters that explained complicated plot antecedents.
While a lot of the dialogue is quite good, much is long declamatory prose that explicates the character or the plot. The intricacies of the relationships and the exaggerations of plot elements became unbelievable and sort of silly in what was meant to be a realistic novel. It just got sort of boring - I finished it but didn't care."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"The story was able to hold my interest. However, I couldn't help viewing the main characters as self-absorbed, shallow children, even the grownups. I couldn't relate to their spoiled mannerisms and lazy lifestyle. But I kept reading because I felt that something, a shocking twist maybe, was going to occur eventually. Yet when it finally happened, it wasn't much. In fact, the twist was ridiculous and senseless. I gave the book three stars because it did at least hold my interest, which some novels are incapable of doing. Lockhart definitely has potential."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"Memoirs are hard to write, and being a good novelist is not a help. A very different genre. O'Brien is unable to find a structure of any kind, and the book suffers greatly for the lack of it.  She is charming, as are her descriptive passages about places, but she leaves out the human detail.  Many famous people are mentioned, but the reader is told little of importance about them, so there is a high level of frustration. But if you like her stuff you're going to read it anyway..."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"It seems that getting older hasn't been a good thing for Mr. Higgins. His writing has become predictable and mundane. In this book Mr. Higgins often repeats character descriptions. It also always seems to rain in ""torrents"" . So much so that London would surely be suffering serious flooding. Also there is less differentiation among characters then there has been in Mr. Higgin's earlier works. I don't believe I will purchase another of his Sean Dillian books. They seem to be all the same story with less and less differentiation among plot lines."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"I read this book and am puzzled.  How does an FBI agent live the lifestyle John O'Neil lived? A double life, abandoning his wife and childred while carrying on affairs with several other women. Meanwhile traveling throughtout the country and the world. Do we want to put our trust in this type of individual.  No wonder many of those who worked with him found him to be egotistical and overbearing, he was constantly trying to hide something.  Something is fishy here. I think probably Ambassador Bodine saw through the man."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"What about the gunshots that the coachman heard? The  gun was found in Captain Denny's hand and brought back to Pemberley. As far as I could tell, it was never mentioned again. This was my major problem with the book - although I enjoyed reading it, I had to keep going back to keep track of the plot. So many confessions and explanations! I recommend this book for its attempt to imitate the writing style of Jane Austen, but I warn fans of P.D. James that this is far from her best work."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"The Kill Order is a zombie virus-trope story (a la Resident Evil and World War Z) that has abandoned almost everything (characters, relationships & unique situations) I loved about the initial Maze Runner books. Feeling more than a little annoyed. I was let down while reading Death Cure, but this one went fully off the rails.

The only note in its favor is that it's a perfectly entertaining stand-alone piece of zombie fiction. Action, excitement, horror, blood, etc. I wouldn't suggest this for kids under age 14, due to violence. But older teens would dig it."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"I work as a senior DNA researcher. This book has an interesting topic, but is not up to date with current knowledge. E.g. in the nienties, people believed chromosomal ends - telomeres - were biological clocks. People believed that telomere length could be used to predict lifespan. Telomeres are huge parts of the junk DNA. The telomere theory was largely abandoned 5-6 years ago. If you know a fair bit about DNA, then this book is not for you. I know the DNA field is rapidly expanding, but somehow I anticipated a more modern book"
Books_5,negative,truthful,"I struggle with a rating for this book, as it is beautiful, thought provoking, and elegant. But between the multiple narrators and the stream of consciousness style, it is a tough read. I recommend those who are advanced readers, and who can handle the complicated narration. But if you aren't an English teacher or a bibliophile, this book will probably make you crazy. It was even tough for me to get through the first third of the book. If you stick with it, and get use to the flow of her writing, you won't regret it."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"From Anthony Gottlieb's ""Think Again"" in the November 20, 2006 New Yorker (subscribers have access to the entire archives): ""In the 1994 best-seller ""Descartes' Error: Emotion, Reason and the Human Brain,"" the neurologist Antonio Damasio reports that Descartes believed in an ""abyssal separation between body and mind . . . the separation of the most refined operations of mind from the structure and operation of a biological organism."" This is actually the opposite of what Descartes believed.

Gottlieb goes on to explain much more, but I don't want to copy all his words. You look it up."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"Not bad.  This is my first HG Wells book.  The opening scene on the ship is very interesting.  Actually, the whole set-up was interesting--this would be the first 1/3 of the book.  After that, however, when Wells' gets into the long descriptions of the manimal creatures, for me, it really tires the story.  Overall, though, the plot flows freely and is mostly interesting.  In addition, the characters are distinguishable and appealing. I really liked Wells' writing style--it's refreshing and unique.  I'll definitely give another of his novels a read."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"This was an illuminating biography of a real boundary breaker.  Francis Perkins, whose politics leaned a bit further left than I personally stand, was nevertheless a thoroughly impressive female leader in a setting where outright hostility and malevolence based on gender alone was not only accepted but seemingly encouraged.  Ms. Perkins' sublime way of sidestepping blustering male counterparts and outwitting (and outworking) male adversaries whilst earning stolid loyalty and respect from open-minded men of the day remain admirable and shocking to a woman born in the late 20th century.  This is a great read!"
Books_5,negative,truthful,"Grisham's book is fast and entertaining, BUT please remember one thing -- this is entertainment, a FANTASY of how lawyers behave, NOT REALITY.  I know people -- ordinary people -- who've been badly hurt and relied on a tort lawyer to seek justice.  And the lawyers delivered.  In America today, I'm concerned this book will serve as the basis for public debate over the legal system -- and that would be silly.  So please, enjoy the twists and turns, but look elsewhere for analysis of what's wrong and RIGHT about our legal system."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"I'm glad this wasn't the first TJP novel I've read or it would probably be the last. The proofreading was done by a third-grader. There was hardly a page that didn't have either a misspelled word, poor (or non-existent) punctuation, incorrect character names and/or breakdown in plot continuity.  All those factors made it very difficult to concentrate on following the story. And adding insult to injury, I didn't like any of the characters. I wasn't upset or happy about events that happened to them.  The conclusion was a letdown except for being an end to the misery."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"This book is okay, but it does have some major problems with the story, it seems underdeveloped and everything is too quick, its like the author couldn't take time to explain anything, i like that this book is quick but it was too fast paced and there was never a time to talk about emotions or charecter depth, just running fast and walking around in the dystopian world, i had expectations and i was let down, i still like the author because of her youtube channel though, lindsay cummings is awesome, i just don't think her book is that great."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"I am one of three sisters who are all avid readers. I bought a copy of this book thinking we could all ""share"" it. The characters are just a little too quirky for me, and I could not relate to any of them. The plot is depressing. The writing is rather stilted. I realized that I can't remember how it ended, so I just pulled it off the bookshelf. I guess the fact that I never got past page 134 tells it all. I wasn't expecting a ""feel good summer read"", but this book just became a chore to slog through."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"This was a tough one for me, I wanted to like this so badly and gave it multiple chances but honestly I just couldn't finish the book. It's just terribly difficult to follow from one chapter to the next when the focus shifts from one character to the next. I really liked the movie and thought the book would be great but sadly its one of the few times where I actually liked the movie better than the book. Where the movie benefits from the unique story, the book struggles with it as it just makes it too difficult to follow."
Books_5,negative,truthful,I have read and own every WEB Griffin book written to include the ones that his son 'helped' write or wrote completely. I can tell easily what was written by father and what was written by son. And while the son is growing as a writer...he is not at the level of his father. The marketing of this book makes it seem like WEB Griffin wrote it and to me it seems almost fraudulent for book seller to market the book as such. I will have to decide on the release of the next book if it is even worth buying.
Books_5,negative,truthful,"Emphasis on the mundane details of the characters slows the plotting the first third of the book. The author didn't seem to give Cat enough abilities to actually succeed in her quest to deal with learning about her background, living with a forced marriage, and picking sides with a tumultuous politics. She benefits mostly from the strengths of others. Another coming of age story. Fortunately the rest of the book's plot twists do a better job of keeping you with the book, though Cat's character still had weaknesses that didn't convince me she could be anything but a pawn to others plotting."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"I was given this book as a Christmas gift, and I read it in a couple of hours.  Albom presents a ""heaven"" without a God and without joy.  I found it trite and depressing.  As far as I can figure, Albom thinks heaven is a way to create closure and explanation for one's life that is not possible in this life.  That makes far too little of both heaven and life on earth.  If you are at all introspective or a believer in any kind of loving god, this book won't get you any farther along the road."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"Hackneyed with sparse flashes of inspiration would be my synopsis of this title. The author's work is a broad-stroke pastiche of stock types stitched together with boilerplate. The action scenes are well put together, but the whole book starts to feel repetitive, largely because of the ""tell not show"" style. The author is at pains to throw out hints of a larger world, but nothing seems to gel. The character names, seemingly ripped from a child's daydream, are particularly jarring if you're trying to take any of this seriously. Feels kind of like Neil Gaiman's stuff does in his lesser works, forced and unsatisfying."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"The story line is ok, same old, same old mostly. The strength as always is the technological imagination and imaginative battles. Unfortunately, the research and writing (and copy editing) have gotten so sloppy as to be disracting. Several times in the first few pages ""criteria"" is used as a singular noun (ie, the criteria is...). Biceps is parsed to bicep, as if that makes it singular, and, most amusingly, during a scene at a Lakers' game, Kobe Bryant banks in a foul shot to win the game. I'm pretty sure Kobe has never banked in a foul shot intentionally. All in all, a lazy effort."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"I wanted to love this. Shoot, I wanted to like it. I've read and reread all the Amelia Peabody books for decades now; they are hands down my favorite fiction. Regretfully, The Painted Queen just doesn't cut it. It feels as if the characters are reading off a really bad script. It's painful to read. I finally resorted to just skimming, and I closed the book with relief at the end. There will always be a blank space on the shelf where this novel falls chronologically. I commend Joan Hess for trying; it was a difficult undertaking that would have been impossible for anyone to complete."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"On average, this reader consumes two or three books per week. Mysteries and thrillers are my primary areas of interest.  I used to really look forward to reading about the exploits of Dr. Scarpetta.  Ms. Cornwell appears to have become fixated on this micro genre since her book about Jack the Ripper.  It seems as though the author has taken this series to such a shocking and depressingly dark side that I will probably never read another book.  The Bone Bed is a disjointed series of interactions between the pathologist and her band of dysfunctional characters that never reaches anything like a conclusion."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"I don't intend to minimize the seriousness of the subject, but I have read many books with similar stories.  So, the story was predictable to me personally, but I really enjoyed her writing that is poetic without being too decorative, and definitely philosophical, particularly the main character's inner dialogues are precious and deeply moving. ""Since he is innocent of any crime they may be charging him with, he could repent only for the act of living."" is one example.  The author did a good job, not vilifying any characters, but presents them as human beings in situations. I would give three and a half stars."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"One of the problems associated with being a popular genre author, is that after awhile, the books just a seem to blend together. I've read everything Grisham has written, and really the only one that sticks out was the Pelican Brief, and The Firm. Gray Mountain has the same mix of ingredients as previous novels. Lawyer with some sort of issue. Injured party needing a lawyer. Some big nasty law firm. Some big nasty corporation. Mix together. Publish.  Not saying Gray Mountain is bad. It is a decent read, but it just seems to be so predictable that you never really loose yourself in the novel."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"I grew up in a similar situation as this young lad is supposed to have grown up in- only it wasn't my mother who was a monster but rather my father.  I have great sympathy for the storyteller but I have to be honest and say that as a book, this piece of work is really substandard.  It makes for very boring reading and serves only to create the ""shock effect"" from all of the horrid things that are revealed.  This should not have been put into a book but relegated a short story in some magazine somewhere. Don't waste your money buying the book."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"as others said, the gaps in this story ruin it.  the end was especially rushed. I wanted to more of the story of hyacinthe. he is an afterthought an almost not there character. how did he get home again? that would have been a story in itself.  the ending just fell flat, oh we see that madame is going to get married. but it was a jump of 2 years later...  the ending was more about Jane than Madame.
this book was again all history, with characters tossed.  I do love the strong women, and the almost loves. worth the read, but missing a lot."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"hell was that. I wish I could give it ZERO STARS. I wish I had back the hours and brain cells I lost reading this book. This is - without a doubt - the WORST book I have read in years. Maybe the worst book I have ever read. I can't put this into words. The plot is unbelievably bad. The character development is terrible. The writing is cliche riddled and awful. As I reached the climatic scene, the culmination of the most bizarre set of coincidences in the history of ""literature"", I was laughing out loud at the absurdity of the plot. What a waste of time."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"Moriarty came up with a clever concept - what if you open a (open-upon-my-death) letter ahead of time. What secrets will it reveal? Good idea but the two problems I had with the book - the secret was revealed too early in a relatively undramatic build up imo and second, I could not keep the female characters straight. They were all involved in vastly different situations yet I still had trouble differentiating between them. I did like the twist at the end where she did a good job of bringing the stories together. I'd read her again though, just because I like author who come up some clever idea."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"DFW deserves a better biographer ... this book reads like a very long Wikipedia article.  I applaud Max for doing original research (interviews, etc.) and roughly half of the information in this book was new to me, but I feel like he should have spent way more time actually WRITING a biography rather than collating a bunch of letters and interviews without really analyzing his subject.  I never get the sense that the author is anything more than a mediocre journalist, or a member of a particularly active DFW list-serv who decided that he wanted to write a book---except that he didn't actually know anything about writing biographies."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"It's another Giada cookbook. I had higher hopes for some new thoughts from her given the title, but it is just more of the same. If you're a Giada fan, you'll probably love this book as well... But if you are looking for more from a cookbook than the same recipes using the same ingredients and the same techniques and the same combinations... Well, don't expect that here. I like cleavage though and she does make sure to include that so I'll throw in a star for that. ;-) In fairness, if this was her first book, I'd view it more favorably, but she is traveling a well-beaten track at this point."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"I enjoyed Mankind's book, so I bought this one.  This one was quite different.  It had a ghost-writer, which is an immediate red flag.  It's quite evident too, since some of the happenings in the book are out of sequence.

The way the Rock talks about losing his virginity at an early age, he makes it sound like it's almost a good thing.  Man, don't promote sexual activity to young kids.

I haven't read a wrestling autobiography since this disappointment.  My advice is this, don't buy this book, don't buy Chyna's book, don't buy Lita's book.  Buy Mick Foley's book if you must read about the life of a wrestler."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"This wasn't the best Robin Cook I've ever read, it wasn't even the best Robin Cook with Jack and Laurie as main characters.  But it did keep me flipping the pages to get to the climax.  Unfortunately the ending seemed a bit contrived and the non-New York characters were poorly developed.  I didn't notice so much with the characters from the medical examiner's office in New York because most of them have been in other Cook novels I've read.
Still and all the premise of the book was enough to keep me reading.  I was not totally comfortable with transgenic technology before I read the book, now I'm even less comfortable."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"This is my second book from this author. My first was ""Honor's Splendour"", a historic romance novel, which I really loved. Garwood managed masterfully to describe her main characters and convey excellently the medieval atmosphere.

However, nothing like this was achieved in ""Heartbreaker"". My feelings concerning this book are very mixed. There were good moments and I sometimes even smiled at the one or the other verbal attack. But the story never really ""took off"".  Maybe this was because the ""chemistry"" between Nick and Laurant didn't really work?  Maybe the story line was just poor and badly elaborated? I can't put my finger on it; in any case it just didn't work out for me."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"I have been waiting impatiently for LMR's newest book and was a little disappointed. It was a great plot, great couple but she seemed to spend way too much time on background information and not enough on the characters falling in love or even interacting together. They seemed to only speak twice and the love affair wasn't developed. When they first hooked up romantically I looked down and half the book was already read. I like great dialogue that shows a connection between couples and LMR has ALWAYS delivered. I hope that now that she used 3/4 of this book to set up the plot the next two books will focus on the couples interacting together too."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"Although the few pages written that involve the main characters were good, there was constant interruptions with the side characters within the book. It was like being at the library and while trying to read a few chapters you were constantly being interrupted by a chatty Cathy. ugh!!  So, with that being said I did read this novella twice, the first time it was every page and I was extremely annoyed and wanted my money back. Then I re-read the few pages that are actually devoted to the main characters and it was enjoyable, but that being said it only took me less than two 1/2 hours to read this twice. Definitely not worth $2."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"An enjoyable book to read, although I do disagree that Robb is the second coming of Ellis Peters.  Her plots are complicated just to be complicated and some of her ""good"" characters are unlovably sticky.  Her insistence on the occasional arcane vocabulary seems arbitrary and pettifogging -- especially since perfectly good modern English words are available for most of them.  (After all, her dialogue is actually a ""translation"" of the Chaucerian language they spoke in, anyway.)  Nevertheless, Robb is a good writer and constructor and the book is a romp to read.  Better start the soap opera here, by the way -- she won't catch you up later in the series if you miss an episode."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"This is a well written book and the author skillfully plays with the reader's emotions.  In fact, you may experience quite a range of emotion -- all except for joy.  This is nothing joyful in this story.  There are times of less pain but there is always pain.  Getting to know the heroine is worth reading the book for even though it is not an easy book to read.  The hero, in my opinion, is an arrogant know-it-all that I could not accept for the majority of the story.  I liked him marginally better by the end. That said, if you can get through the Leningrad seige section, you may enjoy the rest of the book."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"Three and a half stars

If you enjoyed The Reader then you'll enjoy The Speaker which has the same strengths as the first book. You know want to expect with the addition of some new characters and we get deeper into The Guard. Some of The Book passages are more impactful as they help unravel the past and what the future will be.

With so many points of view and several timelines, this is a series which takes its time so read this if you want a fantasy that has a more luxurious pace. I still find some do the characters more compelling than others and the story wanders a bit, but the story is sharpening up as we head into the next book in the series."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"At this time of year I read Christmas romances. Lots of them. (If I could find Kwanzaa, Hannukah, Yule, or other winter solstice holiday romances I'd read those, too. ) Because I love themes of family and redemption that are so often present in these books. It's a fairy tale, but it's a fairy tale I really enjoy. Christmas in Snowflake Canyon brings me all the things I want in a holiday romance. It's got a disabled hero who is recovering from his injuries and the war that caused them (and an excellent presentation of disability), a heroine who absolutely has to grow up and comes to realize that on her own, matchmaking, and lots and lots of family fun. I'll be looking for more by RaeAnne Thayne."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"Honestly, I was very disappointed with this book. I thought since I absolutely loved 'the lovely bones' that this would be another amazing read but I was wrong. The story line had the potential to be a good book but it really just fell flat. It was an extremely slow and excruciating read and the flash backs were not seperated well from the here-and-now in the story. The characters left no lasting impact and overall the book was one that would not leave a trace of recognition in my mind. In a few years I may see the spine of this book on the very bottom of my bookshelf and I will have forgotten I've even read it. That's how much of an impact it left on me."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"I guess at this point it is grind out as many Patterson books as possible as fast as you can to make a killing. Well I got this from the library, thank someone!! The killer (paid assassin  called the Ghost) is painted in such a way that you just have to forgive him. There is murder, murder, murder, but her they are all bad guys. The Ghost is at once smart and dumb... that he lives through the book is only due to the fact that he is fictional. I skimmed several chapters just to get to the ending, and believe me you could skim the entire book and not miss any literary gems. Very disappointing. Robert Parker, where are you? At least you never sold out."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"I checked this out of the library as an audiobook.  I guess the good news is that while I won't get the 14 1/2 hours it took to get through this book, at least I didn't spend money on it.

I was intrigued by the description of the book. It sounded like an interesting story about overcoming adversity...While I understand that nobody is perfect, I felt that each of the main characters should have known better.  Also, there were a lot of unneccesary parts which made the ""story"" drag on and on.  After investing more so mch time in this story, I expected something more out of the ending!

That said, I think the narrator did a great job and her reading of each character was very distinct!"
Books_5,negative,truthful,"Clearly written for and marketed to the audience of the Hunger Games books, this series looks to be not nearly as involving as Collins'. (And could the cover be any more an almost rip-off of the Hunger Games covers?)

The problem with Divergent is that the main character isn't nearly as easy to relate to as Katniss Everdeen. In fact, she's downright unlikeable for much of the book. And the setting, with the rigidly divided society, just doesn't really make sense.

This isn't a bad book, and I'm sure a lot of readers will find it enjoyable, but it wasn't for me. I won't be bothering with the rest of the series because I can't find it in myself to care what happens to these characters. Congrats to those who enjoy it, though."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"Like ALL THE LIGHT WE CANNOT SEE, another recent bestseller that left me cold, I found STATION ELEVEN too (self)-consciously crafted, too mannered, to enjoy. I was never able to escape into the story; the writing, gorgeous as it was, always kept me at arm's length, reminding me that I was reading, well, gorgeous writing. (The plot was pretty predictable too; how many ""virus-ends-the-world"" narratives do we need?) This is not a criticism of the author's abilities, but I personally enjoy novels that are a bit less polished, novels that allow me to forget the craft and lose myself in the story. It's a fine line, I'll admit--too little craft calls attention to itself as surely as too much. But there is a balance, and for me, this novel didn't achieve it."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"Dan Edwardes' introduction to parkour is a well-written and well-organized introduction to parkour, but unfortunately it's too basic and shallow an introduction.  I do not think the first instinct of people who are interested in learning about parkour will be to buy a book -- there are too many entertaining youtube videos that offer a sexy taste of what parkour is like.  And serious readers won't read this book about parkour -- there isn't any intellectual weight to the book, not enough about parkour's history and the psychology of its adherents.  I think the vast majority of people who buy this book (including myself) are novice practitioners looking for a reference book, especially on more complicated movements and proper technique -- and on this front this book sorely disappoints."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"I want to start this review stating that I have read each one of  Kristan Higgins books.  I have enjoyed many ""Just one of the Guys"" being my favorite.  I wanted to love this book too.  I did like it at first.  I just think it is so un-plausable that  someone who had more money than God, could give it up and not be a lot more mad about losing it.  I did like the excerpts of the ""Holly Rollers"", her children novel's.  There were parts that were funny, but most the time I thought it was just trying to hard.  Kristan Higgins is very talented and I love the humor she brings to her novels, this one just wasn't her best work yet."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"As archeological and other scientific disciplines push the stories of the bible further and further into the realm of mythology and spiritual allegory (where it really belongs, rather than a literal account of events in ancient times), books like these are popular among those desperate to 'hold the line'. They serve as some kind of proof or affirmation that the biblical accounts were based in 'fact'. Frankly, this sensationalistic volume, claiming that a bunch of large rocks on a mountainside 'prove' that Noah's ark actually existed, is just the sort of evidence that a religious person would treat with skepticism and scorn as extremely frail, circumstantial and shabby if used to prove that a biblical event had *not* happened. About as much validity is attached to the author's work as that of Von Daniken."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"The story flashes back and forth between the beginning of the 20th century and today; something I don't like. However, it wasn't too much of a distraction. My problem with the story is development of the characters and the total ""disappearance"" of story threads (WHAT was the purpose of the body bag on the dock and how did that play out?). There are characters that just don't make sense, like the hostility of the housekeeper (what was that all about?), the peeping tom proclivities of the butler and the bitchiness of the second wife (which wasn't even discovered until the end of the book (WHERE did that come from?)  The author needs a good editor to point out the weaknesses in his story-telling. I won't be buying the other books in the series."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"I was traveling and wanted something compelling, and even though I usually agree with the negative reviews of best sellers, I figured, How bad can it be?  I read about 20 boring, annoying pages over the course of four days, and then picked up an Agatha Christie, which took me a day to finish.  I just don't think this was well-written, and I don't mean the translation.  I mean the narrative.  Fiction 101 tells a writer to SHOW, NOT TELL.  Instead of making there be anything vivid, let alone convincing, about these people or the pathos of the situation, Larsson tells tells tells.  Additionally, as many have commented, Larsson spends so much time in exposition, there is no forward momentum.  As stated, I couldn't go beyond 20 pages."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"Slow and boring. The only reason why I made it through this book is because I told myself I wouldn't read anything else until this was done since I paid for it. Nothing happens in this book. There were a maybe two slightly-intense scenes that were over after one page. The author jumped from person to person so quickly it makes your head spin, and it was hard to keep track who was who. There was no electricity between Salander and Blomkvist, in fact they had hardly anything to do with each other. The author didn't let you inside anyone's heads, including the main characters. It was all very matter-of-factly written, with no emotion to speak of. Overall, a very frustrating and downright boring book to read. If there's another one, I will probably not bother."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"I was intrigued by the story and it kept me going, but there were a couple problems with the writing. First off, I know a lot of people (ok not in the secret service), but I've never heard anyone talk like the female characters in this book. It feels like they had a photographic memory of a thesaurus when they speak and bring up ten cent words ever so often to let the reader know they're smart. And all the killing. I do believe there's some shady things that go on in this country, but I find it hard to believe all of those killings would happen under the radar. We have such a sensational media, they would be all over stuff like this! If you can get past those things, you have yourself a good read!"
Books_5,negative,truthful,"3 1/2 stars.

The widow, Lilith Davenant, never knew affection before, or during her marriage.  That has remained unchanged since her wastrel husband's demise.  She is thought of as one icy, stiff, no nonsense lady of high principles and morals.

A wager has been agreed upon whereby the Marquess of Brandon/Julian must seduce the newly betrothed and aloof Lilith within six weeks.  This in order to remove his cousin, Lord Robert, from the clutches of his conniving mistress and avoid family scandal.  And so the games begin.

This is an enjoyable read, but not Ms. Chase's best.  It was quite predictable.  And, although it being quite appropriate for the times and Lilith's moral character, I would have liked at least one full sex scene between the H/h.  I would also have liked an epilogue."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"I am probably the only one but I had trouble with this book with the dunna, etc language.  I know that it is based in the time period, but that isn't really MY thing.

 If I take that out of it, it is a fun love story.  Katherine pretends to be someone else when she meet Kirk while trying to steal his horse with her sister.  Katherine is supposed to marry Kurt's brother Ben.  But I love a strong female lead and Katherine doesn't disappoint in that regard, and the mystery of when Kurt will find out the truth keeps you engaged.  But Katherine and Kurt are fun together and this is a good love story.

I have read other books by Sabrina that I have really loved, and the writing style is still amazing."
Books_5,negative,truthful,I bought this book not only because Anne Rice wrote it but because it was being compared to 50 Shades of Gray. It sounded like it was full of sexual scenes when in reality there weren't very many. So that was a little disapointing. Then there was quite a few boy on boy mentionings so that also turned me off a little as well. In addition I thought that she would go into deep detail about S&M...more scenes that kinda thing. I do have to say that the detail in this book was very adequate. She explained every detail as if to make you feel that you were really there. Also the underlying love story was kinda sweet in a twisted way:) All in all this was a good book...not a waste of time...but different than what I'm used to reading.
Books_5,negative,truthful,"I have read and loved every one of the prior KGI books in the series.  The relationship of PJ (the heroine), and Cole(the hero) in the earlier books was one of the same bantering which occurs among all the other KGI operatives, so it strains the credulity when Shades of Gray begins with Cole inexplicably flying to PJ's home town, and then they jump into bed by page 10 or 11!!!  As KGI teammates, they have always cared about each other, so why, when these two otherwise likeable leading characters make love, was it necessary for Maya Banks to write that they each called their physical loving by the ""F"" word?? This is unnecessary crassness, and a big turn-off to the reader. Nevertheless, I will still be hoping for another  KGI  book featuring  Steele as the hero."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"Gayle Lynds definintely has some talent, but as an avid thriller reader, I found her plot and characters too unbelievable--in fact I felt as though I were reading a cheesy romance writer's attempt at murder and mystery.  Everything was just toooooo contrived, from the CIA head, to the Carnivore, to the look-alike cousins, to the clown disguises, to the evil doctor.  For me, this was not a ""page-turner"" and I only finished it because it was loaned to me by my best friend and I had to find out how Lynds wrapped this all together in the final outcome.  Unfortunately, the ending was also lame.  I believe Gayle will get better with practice and I would recommend this as a good airplane or waiting room read if you want something glitzy that doesn't take much power of concentration."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"The length of a book is probably irrelevant to its greatness, but in this case, at least, it imposed a great burden.  I'm a pretty quick reader, but after a recent weekend of off-and-on perusing, I found that I had covered only 51 pages of this gargantuan novel, and that it was difficult to go further in view the slow unfolding of this tale.  I seriously wonder about the high praises bestowed by Stephen King and Richard Russo on the back cover--I may come back to this weighty tome at a later date--perhaps when I have much more time to devote to it.  Yet, I must consider that many of the reviewers on this site have given this work mixed reviews.  And unfortunately, several revealed that the ending was a ""Bummer"".  A definite spoiler and disincentive IMHO."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"J.D. Robb, aka Nora Roberts, does a great job with the In Death series. I've read all of them, some of them multiple times. Her latest effort is somewhat formulistic -- a case long closed suddenly opens up again when a prisoner who she helped to put away escapes and comes looking for her. What makes this different is the link to her mother. I think she missed an opportunity by killing her mother off. I've been wondering about grandparents, aunts, uncles, etc. While there are a few tidbits about the mother's early life -- there's nothing there that really rounds her out as a person. I would much rather have had the mother escape, and show up in later works, giving Dallas a chance to explore more of her past. As it is, I think Robb made a mistake on this one."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"I read this when it first came out and didn't particularly care for it, but sometimes Robert's books that I don't care for grow on me when I listen to the audio version---this one did not. This was wordy with huge sections of nothing-ness that didn't advance the plot and didn't help grow the characters. To be honest I found the intrepid, spunky heroine, Abra Walsh, to be very annoying. There wasn't much chemistry between her and Eli Landon. The most interesting character in my opinion was Landon's grandmother and she appeared infrequently. There were two mysteries running simultaneously with a connection--seemed overly convoluted. I don't feel Roberts set the basis for the story very well. So if you are thinking of giving this book a second try--I don't think you are going to be much happier with it the second time around!"
Books_5,negative,truthful,"McIntyre sets out from California to see if he can get all the way across the country without touching money, relying only on average Americans for shelter and food. It's interesting to note that this was not just a journey of self-discovery; the event was undertaken with the book in mind, which I felt detracted a bit from the actual experience.

If this book can boast anything it is the clear and unadorned view of America from the road. There are no car chases, no big reveals, and no hidden agendas. McIntyre didn't dress it up with rhetoric, religious or political, he acted as the journalist that he is and reported what he saw; average people living their lives who took a few minutes or hours to help another person.

Funny at times and heartbreaking at others, this was a well written and fascinating story."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"I am a huge Russo fan and have read most of his other books.  ""The Risk Pool"" is of nowhere near the same quality as ""Empire Falls"", ""Nobody's Fool"", ""Everybody's Fool"" or ""The Bridge of Sighs."" Having recently finished both ""Fool"" books, it was interesting to note the similarities between the characters SamHall/Don Sullivan and Eileen/Ruth and the towns of North Bath/Mohawk. It was almost as though ""The Risk Pool"" was a first draft of the later novels. All 3 books feature a dysfunctional, alcoholic, ne'er-do-well major character, but he is so much more likable in the later 2 iterations. So, if you have limited time or patience and want to read one book about a dysfunctional, alcoholic, ne'er-do-well in a dying upstate New York town, read ""Nobody's Fool."" It's fabulous, funny and endearing, while ""The Risk Pool"" is slow, depressing and boring."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"Blasphemy is the second book featuring Wynam Ford (now a private detective). In this book, Ford infiltrates a government-run facility which has built the world's largest particle accelerator for a mere $40 billion. (Please suspend your disbelief.)  I like the way Preston has worked together several subplots which all culminate at the end of the book for a complex climax. I am also a fan of Preston's easy writing style--it's good for a quick read. I am not a fan of Preston's portrayal of Born Again Christians--I think it's a bit over-the-top, though I guess it's a reasonable depiction of a very small percentage of rapture-ready Christians. Also, Preston is clearly not a physicist, but I guess not everyone can be perfect. :) Overall, I think Blasphemy was good for a quick sci-fi/techno read, but shouldn't be taken too seriously. It's a beach-book."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"After watching the film I got the novella ready for a good comparation. Coraline is one of the few cases where the film is much better than the book. I think that the main problem is that the original work is intended for young readers. Therefore, the development of the plot and the building of the characters is over simplistic. That is, if you are a grown up reader, probably this novel will not satisfy you. It is too short, and the characters are very sketchy. They lack depth and so does the story. However, if I were to recommend this book to a young reader, I certainly would. If you are looking to read something from this author, probably The Graveyard Book, while still a novella, gets closer to what a mature reader expects. In any case, watch the film. You will not be disappointed."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"H. Paul Jeffers's biography of Grover Cleveland is readable, but I found myself thinking of the famous Walter Mondale phrase, ""Where's the Beef?""  Checking in at a brief 350 pages, made all the shorter by the interspersion of photographs throughout the text, this book is a good bare bones account of Cleveland's life in which the reader never really gets to know the man.  Cleveland is a vastly underrated President, mostly because didn't serve at a time of great national crisis.  So the recent interest in him (no less than two biographies published in 2000) is a good thing.  Jeffers's book did much to enlighten me, but left me wanting more.  I also found a couple of glaring factual errors.  Overall, Jeffers's book is a good introduction to its subject, and that's probably all most casual readers will want to know."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"When Grace Sings by Kim Vogel Sawyer is the second book in the Zimmerman Restoration Trilogy.  The family secrets keep coming.  In this novel, Alexa Zimmerman has opened a bed and breakfast in her grandmothers old home.  One of her long-term boarders is a journalist who has ulterior motives for being in Arborville.  Also coming to the community is Anna-Grace, a cousin of Alexas, who is planning on marrying Steven.  Secrets, both from the past and in the present, abound among the novels characters.  It seems that everyone has something to hide.  I enjoyed the book, but it was not one of my favorites.

I was sent a free print copy of the book by NightOwlReviews.com in return for my honest opinion of the book.  You can find this review on my blog at http://wp.me/p2pjIt-f6, and on Good Reads at https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1255165754."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"As an agnostic female who has achieved success at high tech companies in various positions and who has a well rounded life including volunteerism, I thought this book might help me define what I want to do for the second half of my life.

Instead I found it filled with example of example of people whose lives turned to serving God/faith based causes (granted I skimmed after a while but didn't see any examples of Indians or successful people of other relgions, only Christians).

There were about 5 women out of 61 people total profiled.

On the contrary Po Bronson's book focused on people from all walks of life, not those who have been VP or higher or had ""interesting"" lives.

I found this book completely useless in that it seemed to have sneakily omitted it's true agenda of pushing faith by having NO MENTION ANYWHERE ON THE BOOK JACKET OF RELIGION."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"Mr. Barzun, has on page 739 attempted to define novels as opposed to tales. He is neither an editor, nor as near as I can determine, a writer of novels. Most of his information about ""detective tales"" seems to be based on books written in the 1920s. Do not mistake anything he says as being helpful in the writing of a modern novel. Novels, like clothing, come and go in fashion as to their form and content. You may write what he calls a ""tale"", i.e., the relating of adventures that take for granted motives and settings, but if you pursue that course, you will look long and hard for someone to buy it. The modern reader is interested in motivations, and wants your characters to explain themselves to him/her. Actions and dialog without the subtext is boring, and does nothing to illuminate the human condition for the reader."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"Hello Darkness has a convoluted story line that's forgettable about five minutes after you've finished reading it.  The story's main character, Paris, is the host of a late night radio show.  Besides playing music, she also gives her callers advice.  When a caller asks advice about her love life, Paris tells her to drop her loser boyfriend, who also happens to be one of Paris's normal callers.  This turns out to be bad advice, as the dumped boyfriend decides to abduct her.  This is the start of an incoherent story involving an old flame of Paris, whose son is involved with a sex club website that the abducted girl's father runs.  Yes, it's about as silly as I described.  The book is not well written, not remotely memorable.  I would recommend passing on this novel.
Carl Alves - author of Blood Street"
Books_5,negative,truthful,"It's a nice enough story, but it's just a story. A really simple story presumably for beginner readers. It took me 2 minutes to read the whole book.

Each page has no more than a paragraph of large text and the adjoining page has a black and white illustration. I think the illustrations are the star of the book and probably why so many people enthuse over it. But really, there's no moral, no point, and it doesn't even make sense (how is Ferdinand the biggest and strongest bull when literally all he ever does is sit and smell flowers?)

I know it's a work for children, so I wasn't expecting much, but I was disappointed at how simple and pointless the work seems. I was expecting a book for around 4th-6th grade, not a black and white picture book. Meh.

2 stars.

Books_5,negative,truthful,"** spoiler alert ** I liked the first Jack Reacher book but Die Trying was a mess. ***Warning Spoilers***. Very little worked for me in this book. A kidnapped FBI agent keeps escaping from an escape proof room and they keep just putting her back in it. What?!? Reacher keeps escaping, keeps getting caught and the bad guys still don't kill him. Ok, that's a thriller trope, I can live with that, but it's pretty extreme in here.. None of the FBI agents behave like you would expect an FBI agent to. We can't send in the military, 8 Marines aren't enough against a 100 militia wackos so lets sneak in 3 FBI agents wearing suits. Really? Child leaves open loops about mass suicide and women wanting to escape the compound. Finally, it's a .50 caliber, not half inch. Militia members would know that so Child comes off sounding like a neophyte."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"Totally not what I expected from this prequel/sequel.  The writing did not flow for me and I struggled to keep the characters all separate and identify who was who and what was what.  A bit of a weak reasoning behind what ""caused"" Hannibal to be Hannibal the Cannibal.  In fact, I felt there was a big contradiction in the explanation as Hannibal was so disgusted by the Cannibalism that went on during the war (ok it was his sister they ate) that I did not truly believe that he would resort to it himself.

I am left wanting a further book to bridge the significant gap between this one and the rest of the Hannibal Lector books.

I originally gave it 3 stars out of 5 but when I actually sat down to write my thoughts and feelings, I downgraded to 2 stars as I could not justify any more than that."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"As the author mentions, not everyone is going to agree with everyone on his list. You read about people from the ACLU that provide attornies for NAMBLA, an orgranization that promotes man-boy sexual relationships. You read about people from PETA that say they want to have their skin made into boots and purses when they die because that is how we treat animals. You read about Michael Moore and Noam Chomsky, who just flat out hate the way America is and praise socialism. You read about the head of the NAACP who keeps telling blacks they are victims. I don't agree with everyone on the list, but it is interesting reading. There are a few conservatives on the list too. Michael Savage is on the list and deserves to be. He is one of the most crude and vile humans alive. I really wouldn't call Savage a conservative though, that is just what liberals call him."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"Even if someone gives you The Swede for free, it's not worth your time.  The book comes highly recommended, and it's a Scandinavian thriller, so I was ready to enjoy reading it from beginning to end.  Unfortunately, the plot is poorly constructed and impossible to believe (even for a summer book), and the one-dimensional characters made it a real struggle just to finish.  (To be fair, Ben - the gay lover, is interesting.)

The anti-American tone didn't bother me, but the lack of subtlety or cleverness certainly did.  Here's a sample sentence:  ""Like other Americans, he jingled coins in his pocket and constantly asked for more ice in his drinks.""  Shouldn't the author (or translator) have used ""some"" or ""many"" instead of ""other?""  Is it really possible that every American fits this description?

But that's far less important than the bad plot and characters.  Take my advice, and skip this one."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"Sad that catholics in america, who have eaten so heartily at the protestant table, while bringing so many terrors into the country, would want just more ""spin.""  Against a backdrop of their open border policy (Hart-Celler), the legacy of Kennedy's, the Jesuits inciting Latinos with ""liberation theology""  (anti-anglo-protestantism) to ensure newcomers will be filled with that peculiar hate as the border is opened for them---- such same old!  And instead of a warning to them, and in the world where the Catholic murder of Christians in Serbia so recently (oh, is that just a big silly thing that should be put in ""histoical context"" also?) is known to so many--- one wonders.  Do such people ever begin to take in anything at all of ""the other?""  Even as they moralize?  Even as they harm?  Even as they do not look at their own real history, but only seek to cover it?"
Books_5,negative,truthful,"I mildly enjoyed Last Licks, but none of the subsequent books in this series have come up to the very first one -- The Big Kitty.  The charm of this book, and both of the other books in the series, are the sections where Shadow, the cat, is narrating.  Ms. Donally does know cats -- I will concede that.  She has not made Shadow a super, magical cat with human intelligence.  He's just a cat, with cat-like concerns about food, hunting, and female cats!  The mystery in Last Licks is so-so, and I wasn't sure about the culprit until the end.  But, character development is sadly lacking.  There isn't that spark between Sunny and her cop boyfriend that is so well done by Sofie Kelly in her Magical Cats mysteries.  Unless Ms. Donally picks up the pace, I don't think I will pay to read any more in this series."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"Possibly the worst book I have read this year. Really easy to put down, took me weeks to read it and I would usually finish a good book this length in 3-4 days tops (I have a lot of waiting time to fill so I read while I am waiting to pick people up).

SPOILER (perhaps) - I do not enjoy romance books where the hero and heroine end up having sex within the first few pages, especially when it makes no sense at all. I didn't feel any chemistry between them, I didn't think the way it was written in the historical sense was particularly logical either.

I really wanted to read the Arcane society novels and I have book two, so I might try that one, but it had better be written WAY better than this one.

Was this perhaps one of her first books? I don't know, but I really like JAK usually, just not this one at all!"
Books_5,negative,truthful,"Author Paul Theroux spent several months traveling through the great Middle Kingdom (China) by train in 1986, as that nation's economic surge was underway and change was starting to affect the land.  He details what he found and observed, making a host of political and social observations.  He notes that this communist nation was rapidly becoming capitalist (but remaining a police state) under the market reforms of Deng XiaoPing, and the relief many ordinary Chinese felt that the Mao years and Cultural Revolution were gone.  He also looks at the rising prosperity, a factor that has surprised more than a few western visitors.  Yet reading this book after my own (much shorter) trip to China a decade later, I found his writing style rather stiff, and his adventure not all that adventurist  It does have some interesting if somewhat dated mid-1980's observations of China, a nation that has changed significantly over the past quarter century."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"First, I find the main character, Lucas Davenport, one of the most compelling characters of this genre.  He is the type of guy I would like to be, or at least know, if I were transported to a fictional universe.  He is not quite in the league, interest-wise, as a Harry Bosch, but likable and edgy just the same.  I'm somewhat surprised that he hasn't made his way on the big or little screen.  This being said, however, this book was a disappointed as it degenerates into a story that might play if Lifetime, Spike and the SciFi channel merge.  Sandford has written much better in the past and I'm hoping his story lines have not run dry.  It's a decent beach or summer read but take it for what it is.  A reasonable entertaining work that will kill a few hours but be forgotten  in just about the same amount of time."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"While I still enjoyed aspects of this series, I found this book unnecessarily complex in its mythological meanderings. I am not exactly sure was Atticus did with Granuaile for 12 years, but that might have been more interesting than this book. Things progress on the Granuaile arena, at least.

I think the conversations with Oberon seemed to get a bit too much (too cute by half) and got in the way of the story. As other reviewers have noted, I have been bothered by the brevity of these books and it sure does seem that Hearnes is using mythological twaddle as filler for his recent books. I enjoyed the first few much more, perhaps because they were anchored more in the real world. In the last couple of books there is a magical deus ex machina to solve all the problems of the complicated mess Atticus seems to have made for himself. Not sure if I will continue to buy into this series."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"So glad I bought this book used. I would have been so mad had I paid full price. It is touted as being ""Diabolically Funny"" by the NYT, but I guess that is what they consider funny. I found it to be very sad. A story about upper east side NY parents who have an accessory son who is raised by nannies who have no backbone and as a result are abused by the NY parents. If that's funny I would hate to see what the NYT reviewer thinks is sad. But then again it was set in NY and I guess that is all it takes for the NYT reviewer to think it's funny. Nothing new here. Just a couple of NY writers trying to fascinate us with life in the upper east side of Manhattan and how they think it is funny that apparently many upper east side parents are more driven by money and status rather than raising healthy happy children."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"I enjoyed the storyline, compelling. The threat from any organization has one jumping at shadows and Corchado proves that he is not above the rest when it presents itself to him. I did enjoy the author's history because it parallels my own. I can empathize And true to the case that very few of us imigrants still hold on to hope that the situation in Mexico will improve for the better. It must.

The one thing that kept me from rating this book better was the constant use of translating the 'Mexicanisms' everywhere it is used. Even some that were translated already chapters before. It felt like the author was looking for wordcount buildup. The flow of the story is constantly interrupted by the translated repetitions. Like a street with too many unecessary speed humps you eventually would avoid, I stopped reading halfway through. But I do intend to pick it up down the line to finish the read. I am curious if the author got fed to the tigers."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"I've long loved the Sister Arnold series but this one was just too much to stomach. It's preachy, that looooong section on England's foxhunt had zip to do with the story and was a personal argument from the author.  Second, I found myself pitying the one character the reader was meant to hate--- this character was far more interesting than the good guys. As for the good guys they suddenly came off as smug and downright cruel to anyone who wasn't in the circle of Sister's friends. Speaking of Sister, I didn't like what's happened to her character, she's changed. I didn't like this version of her at all--maybe Brown just didn't put enough effort into this novel. The animals were wonderful but there wasn't enough of them. I found myself getting irritated as I read Hounds and the Fury and had to force myself to finish it. Will I buy the next book? Maybe, if I find it used somewhere and even then, only if it's super cheap."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"Beginning was choppy.  The first-person perspective choice got in the way of character introductions.  Novel doesn't get going until page 50ish.  Disappointed at how the mutiny plot thread was resolved.

Middle was creepy, suspenseful, and had some horrific images.  It also had sermons and discussions about religion that I skipped.  Was more interested in the actual mystery than the author's repeated return to philosophy where he kept asking 'what is the unknown' through various guises.

Ending was scattershot, and it did not resolve anything in terms of character inter-relationships.  Author wrote a super-slow beginning where he painstakingly laid down a hierarchy of relationships, and the ending made no effort to build on or resolve any of that.

I wasn't into this one much.  Russo did have a big success in that the unknown aliens were actually unknown, alien, scary and incomprehensible.  The book over-focuses on the human characters who were little more than talking heads with personal neuroses.  Three stars, parts I liked, parts I didn't."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"I loved How To Lose a Duke in Ten Days, and  I may have loved this one which is the next in the series except that the old saying 'same song, second verse' applies.  This was so similarly written, right down to the same phrasing that it was a huge let down.  The main plot problem was different it was a lame problem.

This was a disappointing story.  I have never seen so much difficulty made out of one kiss.  The Hero could have confided the 'secret' but do to loyalty, he doesn't.  He loyalty was not admirable, it was annoying.

Everything that I loved in the first book, the common sense, the humor, the sensitivity to a difficult subject is either over-worked or just mundane, the second time around.

I am not sure if I am going to try the next one in the series.  LLG started to lose the momentum at the end of the last book and this one just continued to run out of breath."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"I found this short history tedious.  I could not immerse myself in it and often found myself putting the book down out of boredom so that it took me much longer to read than many longer histories I've read in the past.

I believe the main problem is that the author condenses too many characters in the space without rounding the characters out; I do not find myself interested in them because they appear wooden...not enough insight into their personalities and not enough color given to their backgrounds.  I feel the author's past as a journalist has influenced her here.  She can write volumes of information, but it doesn't seem to engage the reader on a deeper lever than a newspaper story might.

I enjoy Christopher Hibbert and Alison Weir more.  They convey complex historical events with a gift for giving the reader a feeling for the time and they have an ability to communicate characters on more of a flesh-and-blood level.  Too bad.  I was looking forward to the book."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"I found this book to be a very enjoyable book to read and if helped fill in a few spaces left about the great names of the Civil War before they became Generals. I have always enjoy reading accounts of the war with  Mexico and seeing how the future enemies of the American Civil War fought  together, saved each others lives on occassions and learnt the common  lessons of war. This is a very interesting and well presented account  although I found the battle scenes lacking in depth but I would suppose  that was not the authors main focus but more on the people involved. I  think it may have helped to have added a few maps of the fighting in Mexico  and the Valley as if you have no prior knowledge of these areas you really  do not appreciate the efforts involved in moving from one point to another.  Overall this is a decent book and most people should enjoy immersing  themselves in this bit of history."

Books_5,negative,truthful,"My title really says it all. This edition was assigned because it was the around which the template for my course was written, and my school didn't care to rewrite the template based on the newer, more relevant edition. This was pure laziness on their part.

This edition mentions nothing newer than 2009, which, in the world advertising, is definitely ancient history. However, it's most unbearable trait was that it is wordy; the text could be cut by two thirds and not lose any valuable content. It spends a lot of time going over the same topics that it did in previous chapters. For a marketing text, you'd think the authors and publishers would have done a better job of taking their own skills to task and put forth a book that is more credible, engaging, and likable. It was all I could do just to keep my eyes open while reading it.

Tip to those reading it now: you only need to read the first one to two sentences of each paragraph to get the pertinent information. The rest of it is just filler."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"Koontz in ""The Husband"" reinvented the definition of a quick read. Read first 20 pages and then the last 20 pages and that's pretty much all you'll need to get the most out of this chicanery.

The book's cover describes an ""earth-shattering"" climax. Reviewers talk about a ""hair-raising"" thriller. Did the standards of the book publishing sink so low that anybody who may have previously published something worthy can now pretty much sell mule's crap to the public by slapping a colorful bow on it and labeling it an ""earth-shattering"" droppings?

Yes, the book starts out just as advertised. But then quickly goes down-hill from there. Koontz did not spend enough time on the characteristics of his protagonist Mitch Rafferty and his wife Holly so that readers connect with them and sustain the nerve-racking feeling from beginning to the end. My pulse quickly dropped after first 20 pages. My hair never raised and as I was reading the climax scene there was no earth movement.

I am sure the movie is coming soon too. If this happens then my hair will surely rise to the occasion."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"This is the final book in the Vatta's War Series.

Overall this is solid sci-fi action. Nothing exceptional, just fine. It would probably be hard to follow if I hadn't read the previous books, but all the characters are growing nicely into their roles, and the plot rolls along to a satisfying conclusion. It's a quick read, and I enjoyed it fine.

Except for one thing.

The very end is just terrible. The end of the plot about a pirate fleet taking over systems and disrupting communication is fine, obvious, but fine. But after that ends, the book goes on to give a tag about the end of the romantic tension between two of the lead characters. It's a terrible scene. I mean, it's short, but just ridiculous. Not funny, not romantic: I was embarrassed on the characters' behalf. The romance isn't built up in a way that should lead to a scene that is so juvenile. For another character, in another plot, sure, whatever, it's corny but might be okay.

For this it just left me with a bad taste in my mouth about the whole book."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"With its title of ""Fat White Vampire Blues,"" I expected a wild, inventive comedy--an expectation fueled by all those ""Confederacy of Dunces"" comparisons. Well, the book is set in New Orleans and the main character, Jules Duchon, is fat, but these are about the only things Andrew Fox's novel has in common with ""Dunces."" Much of Jules behavior is whiny and annoying, which I could forgive if it was used to greater comic effect, but the laughs just aren't there. Other characters aren't much better: Maureen, another fat white vampire, is a little less irritating than Jules, if only because her appearances are in measured doses; and the antogonist, Malice X, seems an amalgamation of every movie stereotype of black men. Only Doodlebug, Jules' cross-dressing former sidekick, breaths any sort of life into this story, although even s/he can't save the flagging pace of the book's final third. ""FWVB"" isn't totally without merit: The first few chapters were engaging enough to keep me reading. Unfortunately, as the story dragged on it became quite apparent Jules is no Ignatius J. Reilly, and Fox is no John Kennedy Toole."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"It's been a while since I've finished a book by Ian McEwan feeling more than satisfied, probably not since On Chesil Beach. From 1997-2001  it  seemed he couldn't miss. Then came a few rocky bumps including Solar, which was plain awful and stopped me from reading his books.

The first 20 or so pages of The Children Act promised to be a return to his heights. I was hoping. He has a knack of writing a gripping opening (notably Enduring Love) and then letting it slip a little... there was so much promise in the opening and then it basically deflated towards the end. He does seem to be predisposed to write about the upper middle class and their emotional problems as they drink fine wines and listen to classical music... alongside the freak-show of the lower classes and their predisposition towards stupidity, violence and slyness.

I wonder why I bother while there is a young man, David Mitchell, who is out there with thunder and lightening. McEwan's writing seems a bit dusty and uninteresting in comparison.

Still, I give it three stars, as he does have his moments."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"This short little novel, which spawned two films, one with Robert Donat and the other with Peter O'Toole, was originally a story Hilton wrote in November of 1933 for the Christmas issue of the British Weekly. It found its way across the pond to the U.S. and the Atlantic Monthly and became a smash hit. It was repackaged as a novel and went on to great reviews and big sales. The story revolves around an 80-ish man, Charles Edward Chipping or Mr. Chips, nearing the end of his life and his recollections of his times, tribulations and triumphs at the Brookfield all boys prep school in England, from before the turn of the century to the 1930s. It has a folksy, quaint, lacksadaisical feel to it, and the tone stays consistent throughout the moments of political strife within the institution, as well as the bombing of the school during WWI. Sweet, charming, inoffensive and ultimately slight and forgettable. If you want something meatier and more substantive from Hilton, try ""Lost Horizon,"" a terrific tale of Shangri-La. This one is fine if you have an hour and a half to kill."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"It's a good message, and the illustrations are really captivating, but the story is very didactic. The message is very clearly ""be yourself"", and it hits you over the head with that. The illustrations are fun to look at. If it weren't for the heavy-handedness of the message it would be a really good book.

The story is reminiscent of Woody Allen's Zelig. There's a girl who really likes lima beans, but nobody else likes lima beans so she always lies and says she doesn't because she's super worried about what everybody thinks of her. Because of that, she starts changing colors based on what other people want her to be. This expands to changing shape, and then becoming even more surreally assimilated into all the furniture and decorations in her bedroom. At the very end, a little old woman says, ""I bet you want some lima beans,"" and the girl says, ""No! Nobody likes lima beans! Wait, never mind I like lima beans!"" And then she eats the lima beans and everything is fixed. Ugh. The message is so obtrusive.

Books_5,negative,truthful,"After 5 novels hasn't Mr. Moody learned that you just, can't, put, a comma, wherever you want to? And at times, well, a comma is needed. This could be credited to extreme sloppiness and mistakes that editors should notice right away. Like the fact that California is 9, not 8 hours behind Amsterdam. Consecutive chapter headings of Wednesday the 10th and Thursday the 12th (with a mention of Friday the 13th) make me wonder what happened to the 11th day of that month. Mr Baker is referred to as ""Mrs"" Baker. (What the hell do editors do these days?) And there are probably others that my quick reading or fading memory have missed.
If  you have a craving for some Chet Baker (who doesn't/shouldn't?) I would suggest de Valk's bio, or pre-order Gavin's. If you have mystery fix, just buy Elmore Leonard. I am not familiar with the other works of Mr Moody, I like the idea of jazz mysteries but heavily shy away from silly clichs and most of all bad writing. If anything I hope this will turn a few people on to the lovely music of Chet Baker."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"I have never read Peter Mayle's ""A Year in Provence"" but I had heard of it, so I was interested in reading his newest ""The Corsican Caper"".  Apparently it is the latest in a series of short novels (this one is very short at 159 pages) whose main character and sleuth/trouble shooter is Sam Levitt.  Sam and his girlfriend Elena come to Marseille for the superb food, wine and scenery.  They stay with good friend billionaire Francis Reboul at his fabulous estate, Palais du Pharo, the biggest and most glamorous private residence in Marseille.  A dark cloud descends onto this gathering in the form of Russian billionaire Oleg Vronsky, who determines that this estate should be HIS, and is willing to go to any lengths to get it.

Basically, this is a quick little read, with a thin plot, lightweight characters and lovely descriptions of food and scenery.  For all of that, it is enjoyable.  Think of it like tapas...small amounts that you can savor briefly.  I would read more of these.

I received this book in exchange for my honest review from the Amazon Vine Program."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"I only use my kindle for text to speech. Sometimes in my excitement I miss the little mention that the publisher has chosen not to let me use the product this way. I have then paid for something that is useless for me. The publisher arbitrarily chose to disable this feature, it makes no impact on them, but for me it's the difference between an enjoyable book and a waste of money.

I eventually got the book through other means and enjoyed it well enough. It wasn't edifying or memorable, but at least it was interesting and provided a somewhat fresh perspective on a global-scale zombie outbreak. In reading this and the Zombie Survival Guide, I get the feeling that Max Brooks pulls a lot of stuff off the top of his head, and his books would benefit from a greater degree of authenticity that comes with more thorough research, something sorely needed in taking a supernatural situation and making it believable. I'm talking about details of combat medicine, traumatic stress, cultural and geographic specificity, fleshed-out characters. Like the animated corpses that shamble through this narrative, I want something to sink my teeth into."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"This was my first (and last) Michael Connelly book. It moved too slow. Connelly obviously knows a lot about inside workings of a police detective because the time spent on trivia was a large part of the book. There was just way, way too many words wasted describing going to work and how police procedures worked or how the hero traveled from one location to another. Or her paddle boarding. Delete it and just say she went paddle boarding and returned. I don't care about how to wax a paddle board. Or the dog that was hers but did nothing to add to the plot of the book. Why bother to have a dog in the story? Or the grandmother? Do you get my drift? There's just a lot of pointless filler in this book.

I read other reviews saying it started slowly so I gave it time to get to the action, but there really wasn't much action. I listened to the unabridged audio version, which was 9 hours 23 minutes long. If ever a book would benefit from abridging, it would be this one, but then it would only be 3 hours long."

By
Scott Turow

This is the first one of  Scott Turow's books I have read and as I understand there was a movie made from this book.

A beautiful lawyer from the prosecuting attorney's office is raped and murdered. Rusty Sabich is chief deputy prosecutor for Kindle County, and his boss Raymond Horgan is up for re-election.  Rusty is handling the investigation of the murder despite the conflict that only he is aware of with his friend, Dan Lipramzer investigating the crime. They first focus on convicted sex offenders that Carolyn helped to prosecute. Then Rusty learns that his boss Horgan had a brief relationship with Carolyn. Meanwhile Rusty's marriage is in a shambles as his wife Barbara knows about his affair. As evidence surfaces Rusty he is arrested for the killing.  But is Rusty guilty?  Or will someone else be found to have done the terrible crime.

Instead of being a predictable legal thriller, like some others I have read, this great murder mystery has plenty of twists and turns through its thick and plot.

The book was supplied to me free of charge and did not ask that I do a positive review."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"Watching a friend's vacation slides may be an agreeable way to spend an evening, but Laurie R. King tests readers' patience with the same technique when she sends Mary Russell and her husband, Sherlock Holmes, to ""The Moor.""

The title refers to Dartmoor, nearly 400 square miles of fields, hills and treacherous marshes in the southwest of England. Conan Doyle set ""The Hound of the Baskervilles"" there, and King uses a rumored reappearance of the hound as the pretext for drawing her sleuthing couple there. They're summoned by the eccentric clergyman, author and hymn writer (""Onward Christian Soldiers"") Sabine Baring-Gould, now nearly 90 and in failing health.

But before the inquiry gets underway, we're given a long dissertation from Mrs. Holmes about Baring-Gould and Dartmoor. Between the suspicious death of a local who wandered off the straight and familiar and the discovery of a body in the good minister's lake, there's nearly 200 pages of Russell reading Baring-Gould's books, Russell talking with the man and Russell riding about the countryside and chatting up the locals. Getting to the heart of the hound mystery takes up the last hundred pages, with remarkably little of the suspense which the novel advertises."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"Cary Grant was gorgeous, suave, a very good actor, and at times could be a controlling and confused man. Dyan Cannon writes about Mr. Grant with openness, and yes, is is HER autobiography as well as his biography in a sense. Covering the years from her start in Hollywood to just about the current day, Ms. Cannon does not hold back in her analysis of what made Mr. Grant tick. Having read several books by other authors, and having a film history background, there was little in the book that made me doubt Ms. Cannon's veracity. Cary Grant was open about his LSD experimentation and was constantly searching for depth and meaning in his personal life and retired at probably just the perfect moment; before his looks were regarded as passes to 1960s filmgoers and just as he himself was growing bored with his work.

The latter part of the book focuses on the repercussions of her marriage and life with Cary Grant and much was new and enlightening. (I do not spoil plots or details). A loving mother, continuing to act and work in films, Dyan Cannon has written a very good addition to the Hollywood biography canon."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"If you are a reader who enjoys the challenge of a time sequence that is replete with starts and stops you will enjoy this novel. Set in pre- WWI England, the main character, Ursula, repeatedly dies and then is reborn into a new life.  Everything she did previously is lived again with the exception of the events that led to her death in the previous life, which she has, upon rebirth, mysteriously learned to avoid.  However easy it is, or not, to follow the plot line, the often sporadic insertion of monologue and dialogue that is foreign to the action, makes the text confusing to the point of unnecessary exhaustion.  There is nothing more to recommend the text; by way of attractive characters, interesting events or intriguing action, that might cause the reader to make the effort to decipher it.  From the initial pages you know that Ursula is destined to make an attempt on Adolf Hitler's life.  You might think that tumbling through time and the text would make it worth the trouble.  It did not.  I was about 60% of the way through when I put it down for good."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"I have a kindle and read all the books in this series except for Demon Angel, which is not on kindle.  I love this series.  I found it clever, sexy and intelligent.  Except for the author's annoying habit of over using names in conversation, I felt they were very well written.  So I decided I would buy the paperback of Demon Angel and read how they all began.  I was bitterly disappointed.  While reading I got the sense that I was plodding around in a thick fog, going nowhere.  The behavior of both Lillith and Hugh made little sense and I am currently at page 188 and realize I am receiving no pleasure reading this book, and so I have given up.  If you have not begun this series, I strongly recommend you skip this book and begin with Demon Moon.  Ms. Brooks explains enough in future books that you won't miss out on anything having missed Demon Angel.  I'm hoping the reason this book is not available on kindle is because the author has plans to rewrite it into something worthy of the other excellent books in this series."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"On the off chance that like me you've read Big Chief Elizabeth and Samurai William (or at least one of them), it may be worth me stating that in my opinion this is the least impressive of the three. In agreement with the review below, Nathaniel's 'story occupies only a small part of this book', and it remains a trifle unconvincing that his 'endeavours were pivotal in the course of history'.

That being said, there are all the usual details - from tragic biographies to prolonged and agonising torture - to keep you turning the pages, and it is certainly interesting to read once again about how horrible those Dutch were to the poor English (as can also be read about in Samurai William). Then, of course, Milton is great at weaving a yarn together, and it is always fascinating to read about the exploits of various larger-than-life adventures; particularly those exploits centred on parts other than the 'spiceries' themselves. The book is a light and enjoyable read, but it is most certainly worth a read. Milton's greatest contribution to history is, I feel, his abilities to take a reader's imagination so convincingly back to a time of pirates and uncharted adventure."

I see that it comes with nice online components and is fairly modern but as a student reading it for a self-propelled style course that I took for fun I found that many of the test questions weren't even in this material and I could read it and not know about more than half of what I read. I did appreciate details that weren't in the textbooks of the 1990's like union strikes and monopoly dealings and a greater emphasis on race relations in mining and Native American dealings (more history being revealed) but over all I found the book a bit boring and strangely organized and lacking in depth.-- It jumps too fast post 1900 onward.--It seems to be cramming more history into the same length of textbook these days is their solution to the problem of more and more history being revealed, but I found it more of a problem. 2.5 stars."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"Overall, I enjoyed the story. Some of the details/actions were not consistent with the time period. Also, while I think flawed characters make for much better stories, there are better ways to write in the ""flaws"" than having an antagonist point them out at every opportunity. Also, the attempt at romantic tension between the heorine and the male character grated on my nerves. The male character was presented, first to last, as an insufferrable jerk, though the implication was that he's really just misunderstood. He's being an ass to push her away because he really wants to be close to her but can't for reaon xxx....  SMDH. Very irritating. This old saw is too reminiscent of soap opera sterotypes and bad dramas. If the reader can get past these issues, and the author can learn to avoid these sterotype pitfalls, future books by this author could be very promising. I think the author could really develope a rich fictional world that would keep many mystery readers turning pages. Just, please, drop the annoying romance sterotypes, there are better ways to develop intimacy, meaningful and realistic connections, between characters. (A little more research on the crime element of the time period might help too)."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"It took me 2 attempts (months apart) to make it through this book.

I don't enjoy adventure stories all that much. I need my brain to be stimulated by conniving plot twists or revealing secrets or a romance. Adventure stories don't provide that for me. They move at a slower pace that just builds and builds but never seems to go anywhere. And that is the problem here.

This story is pretty much documenting Leah's journey West once she discovers the truth about her uncle. I wanted gun fights and showdowns, not the dark reality of a pilgrimage West.

That being said, the realism is one of the highlights of the novel for me. What I really enjoyed about this book was that it was very realistic. The pilgrimage to the West was a gruesome and often deadly journey for those who decided to try it. Whether it was for gold or a new life of freedom, some people and families found it to be worth the risk and I think that is all beautifully represented here. Carson has done her research about what was in store for these people and it shows throughout her writing. For world-builder fans, you will be more than satisfied with this."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"I have just quit reading Nelson DeMilles The Gold Coast. In 175 pages of rather well written prose about a rich woman I could never stand and from the viewpoint of her passive-aggressive attorney husband living in a snobby neighborhood of the famous Gold Coast of west Long Island, New York, let me tell you what happened.

Other than the narrator getting his ashes hauled a few times by his kinky, often emotionally unavailable wife, expressing a massively slow burn about his Mafia Don new neighbor, and the worlds shortest mid-life crisis, nothing has happened. Let me repeat that. NOTHING. He has described rich home after rich home, and some pleasant pieces of New York society historydropping a few names we know like Rockefeller, Rothchilds and so onother than that, zilch. Bupkis.

I do like the quietly snarky sense of humor he shows us but seldom shows the other characters, but other than that? This book is a waste of my time and yours. So, after reading it about a quarter of the way through, and it is a chubby book, I got pissed and pitched it up against the wall then rethought and put it in my bag for charity shops.

I have read a few of Gray's books and loved each novel because each one had a surprise element. However, I felt like this novel fell short and lacked excitement. The person who causing all of the trouble was very obvious even though there were two people of interest. I did like how Gray humanized and showed each characters' struggling between doing what is right and following their hearts. Fans of Gray's work would be happy to know this novel has recurring characters."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"I had such high expectations for this book. I have been wanting to read it since it came out and finally got the chance to read it. Well the first chapter was good. It was enticing. It had its own little plot and likeable characters. Then came the second chapter and that was also okay. Less exciting, more people to meet. Then the third chapter came along and there were WAY too many people. A whole band of them, at least one of which who had a regular name and then a nickname and that was just too much. And then the fourth chapter, which was yet more characters, not just one or two, but a whole passel of them, some of whom are using their real names and also a nickname and it was just too much. I could not keep all of the characters straight. And I know that the book is told from a series of other characters' viewpoints about a couple of characters, but it's just too much. I could not handle all these people. I really liked the writing in the first chapter, so there's that. I just can't read books that throw way too many people at me all at once."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"This book was quite interesting to me. I agree that many people, even Christians can't handle laments. Most of us are silenced and reduced to ""faking fine. "" No one really wants to know anything about the negative. But everyone seems to be a counselor and offers advice that's unwanted and unneeded. I couldn't relate to the author's neverending supply of supportive friends who helped her all along the way with her issues. I found myself wanting to feel more sorry for her lack of relationship with her family, but I had some questions. She left her brother out of her story almost altogether. How did he react to events?

I couldn't relate to the somewhat shallow craving for shopping and closets full of shoes. I don't lament things. I'm not into prosperity gospel. And who gets to go on a long retreat to Alaska to heal? Almost none of us. I think I was hoping for more of a workbook than a personal account. The book touches on a lot of good points about biblical laments in Psalms, Job, Lamentations. Some of the stories became repetitive and I think it could have been condensed a bit. The book is a good commentary of realizing that many of us are not ""just fine."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"I'd give it 3 and a half stars, if half a star was possible.  Derleth's take on Lovecraft follows a certain theme that doesn't change all that much from story to story:  thin, white, bookish, guy inherits spooky old house by some half-forgotten relative/friend; weird stuff happens that he can't explain; bookish guy inevitably does research in old tomes at Arkham; and the story ends in a paragraph of italics that's supposed to fill you with a sense of horror.  The sense of spookiness that permeated throughout Lovecraft's stories is absent, replaced by an extremely predictable italicized ending.  I have to agree with the reader from San Francisco, the Good gods versus the Bad gods was not a great idea.  Of course it doesn't really matter, since a few gods are merely mentioned in passing when the bookish guy does research at Miskatonic.  Derleth seems to prefer Lovecraft's theme of evil rednecks in the backwoods of Massachusetts rather than promoting anything in the Cthulu mythos.  All in all, stay far far away from this book if you've never read Lovecraft, and if you have read him than you don't really need to be in a hurry to pick this one up."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"I am a big fan of John Grisham, not only of his legal thrillers but also of his more literary undertakings. ""Playing for Pizza"" was just a huge disappointment for me. It felt like a potboiler Grisham dashed off to justify the expense of an Italian vacation or to make use of some scrap notes he'd made while working on a larger project.

The book's characters are quite 2-D. Ex-NFL quarterback Rick Dockery does undergo a small amount of personal growth in his acceptance of his situation in Italy but that's a pretty minor transformation against a backdrop of predictable stereotypical supporting cast members.

The plot is all but non-existent. It's really a slice of life rather than a true narrative. It has a beginning and a middle but no end. Not only is the story line unfinished (that's not a crime, but in this case it's piled on top of the other issues the book presents and adds to the sense of incompletion), it's not clear it would have been interesting had Grisham bothered to bring it to a conclusion.

Overall, it's not only that I expect more of Grisham, it's that I expect more from any good book. This book just doesn't rank as one I'd recommend to anyone."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"Well, that's that... I gave Jordan three chances to get the series back to what it used to be, and it's just not happening.  I won't be buying another Wheel of Time book in hardcover. In fact, I may just go to the library and check a copy out next time, rather than even buying it in paperback.
I used to be impressed by Jordan's ability to have so many plot threads going on at once, and yet tying them all together.  Now I'm just bored by it.  He has too many characters doing their own little thing in their own little places... I can't fault him too much for not moving the series forward, the problem is with the way he has the story set up, he _Can't_.  There are too many plots... but he could do a much better job in focusing in on those plots and making something happen within them.  The female characters are extremely under-developed.  They're all so similar...  But again, an author must have a hard time developing characters when he's thrown so many into the mix.
The end of this book was fairly decent.  I can't say this book was better than the last two, however."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"All the hundreds of thousands of wannabe writers out there (including yours truly) and THIS is what gets published.  Granted, it's a great premise, its just terrible writing and saddest of all (judging by the success of this series) no one can tell the difference.  But by all means if you want writing that tells instead of shows, ideas that don't develop any further than it takes to read in a chapter about the length of a visit to the toilet and characters as memorable and charismatic as the physical paper they are printed on, don't delay, this is the book you've been waiting for.

On the other hand, it's only fair that I point out that I've seen the comic book version and it's perfectly suited for that medium, it works much better in that form.

I'm not here to bash the writer, her success or loyal fans, just offering a warning to anyone who might stumble across this review to reconsider before diving in.  Ms Hamilton is cackling all the way to the bank, I'm certain her writing has improved over the course of the series  and I certainly don't begrudge her success one iota.  I just didn't like her book, in a big way."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"I greatly enjoyed the Decker/Lazarus early books at the beginning of the series.  They were character driven and shared the lives of the main characters, Peter Decker and Rina, as their relationship grew into marriage and family.  More literary in writing style and with characters you came to care about, you almost forgot the books were in the ""Mystery"" genre.  Admittedly, I hadn't read a number of the novels in the middle of the series, but jumped to ""Gun Games"".  Although the elements of the early Decker/Lazarus novels were there, it seemed more ""commercially"" than ""character"" driven.  The ""F"" word abounds and even when it might fit the character and situation; it is over used.  Other graphic sexual terms and situations are also included.  The book seemed a mixed up jumble of young teenaged romance and sex with a mystery thrown in involving more of the same.  That said, the main characters, the foster son of Decker and Rina, 15 year old, Gabe, and his 14 year old girlfriend, are characters you like and hope to see as adults moving on with their lives in a later book.  But a lot less of the sexual details and foul language would be nice!"
Books_5,negative,truthful,"It is time to wrap this series up! Before I even read this book I could have told you the following things were going to happen:
* Someone would die.
* Lulu would wear something ""poison green""
* Stephanie would be in a bind and call on the men in her life for help.
* Something would blow up.
* Stephanie would not be driving the same car at the beginning and end of the book.
* Grandma Mauzer would go to at least one viewing at the funeral home.
* Stephanie would sleep with both the men in her life.
Well, I was right. This book is chick-lit-lite -- it took one evening to read and while enjoyable there was nothing that knocked my socks off. And it's getting hard to justify spending the money to buy the book instead of waiting to check it out of the library or borrowing it from a friend. In fact, I would recommend either of those options if you have not already purchased the book.
It is time for Stephanie to make a decision and move on. Let this series end at 20 and call it a day.
It's time for Stephanie Plum to grow up, her stupidity is getting tiresome.
Let 19 be the book where she makes a choice and 20 be the wedding. It's time."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"I loved Beg for Mercy and Hide from Evil. This book is a part of a series. I was really excited this book came out. As soon as I saw it I grabbed it. This is Talia story. She is getting her life back together after she was tortured. She was in awful 'relationship' which is mentioned in Beg for Mercy. She was helped by Jack. I liked Talia the most part but she got stupid which I found annoying. Jack our hero is there to protect/help Talia (she doesn't know he was)had potential but he fell flat for me. This book talks about Gemini Security/Gemini Men. I felt like Alden was just trying to get me to buy those books. Not going to happen.  This book seemed rush and didn't have the depth I felt in Beg for Mercy and Hide from Evil. Not a terrible book but I certainly won't be grabbing a book by Alden just b/c she wrote it.  By the way, if you want to read this book I recommend you read Beg for Mercy 1st. It explains the back story which you really don't get in this book. If I didn't read the 1st 2 books in the series I think I would have given it 2 stars."

Glocks = Do not have safeties.  Contrary to what you think.

Ford S10 = Umm, it was Chevrolet, not ford that made this little pickup. Ford makes the Ranger.

Clip = Hanguns have Magazines, a couple of models of extremely old rifles used a clip, which has an entirely different design.

Steel-Plated Revolver = Umm. What is this?  What is the steel plating? more steel? is the core lead?  Gimme a break.

These are just a few of the glaring errors with both of these authors.  They are playing in a sandbox where they know nothing, but at least they know nothing with consistency because these errors pop-up repeatedly.  Over and Over again.

I really despise lazy authors who do not at least do some research before they begin writing about something they know nothing about.  Quality material requires research guys, and this is not quality material.  There's a reason why some authors are constantly on the best seller lists, and some aren't, and this is why.

Get it right next time or stop writing.  A novel is not a comic book where your audience is in their teens and incredibly forgiving (or ignorant of such things).

Books_5,negative,truthful,"I bought this book with great expectation having read the glowing reviews here at amazon.  The premise of the story sounded intriguing---two 'ordinary' couples meet and form a friendship that lasts a lifetime.  Alas, real life is often dull and this book redefines dull.  The promise of youth and the sadness of aging no matter how gracefully, the love that endures sickness and health, the value of true friendship are all examined and with introspective honesty.  However, what isn't in the book, the great moments glossed over or ignored, left this reader wondering how Wallace Stegner got to be so renowned.
On a more positive note, if you can endure the first 3/4 of the book, the last 1/4 will be uplifting.  The reader will finally get some insight into Charity and Syd's dysfunctional marriage, Larry's unquestioning love for the invalid Sally, and the universality of Stegner's premise that one of us doesn't differ that much from another, each generation repeating its parents so that everything returns upon itself, repeating and renewing until the present can hardly be told from past.
Stegner writes a convincing enough narrative about the grace of surviving life, but as for me, the next time I want a story about nothing, I will tune in to a Seinfeld rerun."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"For the untrained Clive Barker reader, Abarat will seem like a vivid dream, an elaborate creation, a thing of wonder and beauty to be praised and revered. To the serious Clive Barker reader, it amounts to the PG-13 version of Weaveworld and imajica combined. Clive has taken to the all-ages genre and created a series that is sure to make him richer than he already is, but he's not doing anything new and that is very frustrating for the Constant Reader. Abarat is a story about Candy Quackenbush who lives in the dullsville town of Chickentown, Minnesota. She is an outcast, an exile, and she can't wait to get away. Well. as you guessed, adventure finds her and she winds up in The Abarat, a series of islands in the nether world each dedicated to a certain our of the day or night. Yawn. Very formulaic for Barker. This is Clive on cruise control. This is Clive on auto-pilot. This is Clive writing for the sake of writing, being weird for the sake of nothing better to do. Clive Barker is good at being outlandish and strange and thinking up attorcities and oddities is his modus operendi. Get a clue. This is nothing new."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"I hate to give one star to any book but this was really awful. Perhaps the story would have been better if I didn't have to stumble through considerable editing difficulties. Whoever was in charge of this department at Warner books should have been fired. My copy is the first edition and there were numerous punctuation problems. So much so that it detracted from the story. I have never, I repeat never, read a book with this many mistakes. Willa Hammer headed west after losing her adopted family. Settling in the Bighorn Mountains she comes upon various melodramatic characters that think only of themselves. One of the characters just grated on my nerves. You'll know who it is without naming names. Smith Bowman, the hero, is a loner in many ways. When he meets Willa he is leery of her at first. In denial, he doesn't want to admit to himself that he is attracted to her. It scares him. Of course, we know how the story ends. If you find another edition without all the mistakes AND if hokey language doesn't bother you, you may like this romance.

Books_5,negative,truthful,"Unfortunately, I just finished ""Wild Fire"" and am sad to report that DeMille's quality is continuing the slide downward that began with ""Night Fall"".

Through his magnus opus ""Up Country"", Nelson DeMille was my favorite fiction author. But in his last two books, he's decided to weave his stories in and out of catastrophic real-life events. I frankly don't care about John Corey's posiiton on George W. Bush or when to invade Iraq...I appreciate an author who creates an entirely new universe and populates it USING HIS IMAGINATION. Just like DeMille used to do in his other novels. Shoehorning real life events into his recent books has taken priority over a strong narrative and the storytelling suffers under this neglect. It's a blatant attempt at broadening his appeal that does so at the detriment of his longtime fans' intellect.

It's also worth noting he's writing books now that run about half the number of pages his past work offered. It's been pointed out he has contractual deadlines to deliver a book every November...I personally don't feel like this is a valid justification for the startling decrease in pages and by extension, story.

Overall, it's sad to realize that the author whose work I fell in love with is no longer committed to the same level of quality he used to consistantly provide."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"Why, oh why, do I keep on reading these! I have to chalk it up to sentiment, and perhaps the slim hope that a new ghostwriter will revive this once-charming series.

Simply put, this is a mess. There is the usual check-in with the mob of Pickax residents from earlier books, most of whom make brief and baffling appearances with little or no relation to the plot. The residents of this decidedly odd town - 400 miles north of reality - show up in droves for bookstore openings, stultifyingly dull lectures and amateur theatricals. (Thank god they seem to have given up eating pasties at every opportunity.)

The cats are little more than furniture these days, with Yum Yum barely making an appearance. Polly now manages a bookstore, but remains her snobby, charmless self. Qwill seems to have become the town errand boy, and, of course, pounds his mustache to a fare-thee-well.

The plot? It almost looked as though there would be one this time. But the reader is drawn in, only to be cruelly disappointed by an ending that lacks, well... an ending.

Go back and read the first three or four in the series, especially before Qwill moved to Pickax. They were certainly light reading, but the plots were intriguing, the writing was tighter and the books then deserved their Best Seller status."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"Let me preface this review with noting that I absolutely LOVE books where a dog or animals are the main or central character.

The Art of Racing in the Rain is nothing more than the political, social and anti-science commentary of the author who disguises such as being told or observed by Enzo, the dog in the book. I was really looking forward to reading this book, especially given the many rave reviews this book garnered, but I was highly disappointed with many aspects of this book.

Analogies to racing (automobile) are exceptionally redundant, and the characters were, I thought, not well developed in the least. The story plods along with Enzo seeing the world through his eyes (and the shortcomings of not possessing thumbs), which had promise; but unfortunately the author uses the canine as an outlet for his own political and social commentary.

Yes, there were a few chuckles throughout, but sadly, the book is more a success of exceptional marketing rather than exceptional writing or storytelling.

As mentioned, I love books where the dog or animals are the main character(s): If Only I Could Talk, White Fang, The Call of the Wild, The Wind in the Willows and many others. Unfortunately, The Art of Racing in the Rain, although it held promise, falls very short if you are a fan of these types of books."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"Here Feist continues his Riftwar romp with a new quest as lighthearted as his earlier works.  Though a bit more focused in plot than ""Magician,"" Feist follows the formulas used in the earlier books,  devoting most of his energy to action narrative in which the characters  remain caricatured stereotypes all too familiar to fans of the genre.  His  cast of characters neglects none of the usual inhabitants of the fantasy  realm, ranging from elves and goblins to dragons and pirates, as well as  the inclusion of samurai (The Tsurani), Moslem warriors from the era of  Saladin (The Empire of Kesh), and here ewoks thinly disguised as  ""gwali.""  The princes of the realm are handsome and heroic, their  princesses beautiful and spirited.  The good guys, even when rascally  criminals, are brave and true and, after much hardship, their defeat of  evil is assured.  All in all, a storyline that could have been lifted from  a D&D script.  I continue to find a lack of weight or substance to the  tales, and harbor some doubts that the ""Riftwar Saga"" will  eventually devolve into a series of repetitive, banal quests. Nonetheless I  will admit that so far Feist's stories do offer facile moments of unadorned  diversion and amusement."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"This is a fascinating, if slight, tale about one part of the massive Oxford English dictionary's creation. Basically, the story recounts how a paranoid bi-polar man helped write and research a huge portion of the world largest dictionary. The professor is the then editor who befriends the man, not knowing his new-found contributor resides in an insane asylum.
Along the way we get fascinating peeks into the creation of the OED, Victorian and Edwardian views on mental health and quite a few other asides.
I am not sure that this is a book so much as a long magazine article (think New Yorker style). Occasionally it seems that Winchester overuses foreshadowing and previewing to ""fluff"" the work up into book length. At one point he mentions that the event he was going to talk about was the most important even in the 20th century. What he does talk about next is very interesting, but he offers no clue as to how, even in the context of the story, the event was ""the most important event."" Hyperbole like that is strewn throughout the book and does not need to be. This story is fascinating on its own.
A good light read. It is probably an excellent introductory text for College students as it is more of a springboard to other topics than a complete in-depth exploration of anything on its own."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"Well, I struggled a bit to write this review and I really wanted to give it 4 stars. But I couldn't in the end because I don't think that would be comparing ""Devil's Dream"" fairly to Bell's ""All Souls Rising"", a novel I find the richer and more moving of the two, and the novel to which I would attribute 4-5 stars.

""Devil's..."" is all in all a very entertaining, original and informative read. The story of Nathan Bedford Forrest is a truly fascinating one, and some of the literary tools Bell uses (i.e. the bits of ""magical realism"") add to that fascination . Some of the events in the first half of the novel regarding Forrest's family are powerfully done, e.g.the affairs Forrest had are described in a interesting, non-moralistic, human way; the death of his daughter is devastating..

But in the end, the constant chronological swings tired me. After loving the first 250 pages of the novel, I virtually flipped through the last 50. My sense was that what was described in those last pages had already happened earlier in the book (e.g. another horse shot dead from under Forrest after another heroic charge...). I had also grown tired at this point of trying to decipher Forrest's tennessee accent.

I remain an admirer of Smartt Bell. But ""All Souls Rising"" will provide readers a better experience of his talent"

Andre and Devon are wonderful characters with great chemistry when they are in the throws of passion.  But, on the other side of that Devon starts out strong and fearless then turns to ""Andre"" mush and then fearless again.  It isn't very consistant.  Then there is Andre, who is a super hot French captian, but is just a brute!!!  There are times he is a head strong man ready to dive in and save the day, and other times he is simply a donkey's butt!

The plot is a strong one, untill we get to the island, then it is rushed alittle.  That is when the story becomes ok for me.  The ending ties up all loose ends, but not very engaging.

The other charachters in this book (Minter, for one) are really great.  I was hoping the second book was about him.

So, basically there were somethings I didn't like about the book, but the bulk of the book was good.  There is some love scenes, so beware if you are looking for clean romance.  (They are tasteful as far as passion goes)

It was a free read from Kindle, and even if I had purchased it, I wouldn't have been disapointed."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"""Destroyer Angel"" made me sad. It's not only the violent, depressing story, but also the fact that this may be the last Anna Pigeon novel I read. I have been reading Nevada Barr's books for many years now and have been disappointed in the dark turn this series has taken. I absolutely loved the earlier books in this series, which could never be accused of being ""cozies"", but included wonderful descriptions of National Parks and a variety of realistic characters. I thought the premise of this story being a story of survival sounded intriguing, so I gave it a try. After finishing the book, I can say I liked it better than recent installments such as ""The Rope"", but didn't like it nearly as well as earlier books in this series.

I liked the vivid characterizations of the female characters and descriptions of the setting, but the male villains are interchangeable and their actions are appalling. Having the story told from different points of view added some interest, but also added redundancy and slowed the pace of the book. Some may enjoy this as a story of good vs. evil, but it's not my kind of story and even the great character of Anna Pigeon couldn't save it for me. The author has obviously chosen to take this series in a new direction, so it looks like we may be parting ways."

Books_5,negative,truthful,"The first few chapters were very hard to get through, because they described a lot of  domination and brutality. It was hard to read how the Normans and Vikings treated these women and innocent servants. I'm not a big fan of rape in romance novels (although I seem to remember it being popular in the 70's) but it is historically accurate. I didn't like Wulfgar forcing the heroine to have sex with him. It was very difficult for me to like him after that. He treats her so badly that it's abusive, and I didn't warm up to him until towards the late middle of the story.

There's a lot of melodrama in this novel. At times Aislinn seems bi-polar, swinging back and forth between rage and happiness within one scene. Her mother acts so hysterical and goofy she's unbelievable. The female villains are horrible but it was kind of fun reading about them.

The language the author uses is meant to sound medieval, and at times it was hard to follow what the characters were saying. It got a little formal and flowery at times, and slowed the story down for me.

There is a real romance in there!  I did warm up towards Wulfgar. The characters did seem more believable and sympathetic towards the middle of the story. Towards the late middle to the end I could not put it down."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"I Heart Hollywood is the second book in the I Heart series by Lindsey Kelk. Angela Clark is back and she's still living in the United States, writing for a hip magazine, and debating whether to move in with her sexy new boyfriend. Her latest work assignment is interviewing fellow Brit and actor James Jacobs...in Hollywood. All is fun and glamorous until paparazzi snaps compromising photos of Angela and James Jacobs. The gossip spreads and threatens her job, reputation and relationship.

I really liked Angela's independent attitude and guts in the first book, I Heart New York. But she loses this burst of ""I Am Woman"" in this book. She seems helpless and clueless. I enjoyed reading more about her best friend Jenny, who is healing from heartbreak and discovering a potential new career. Hopefully Angela just had a temporary mental setback and will be back to normal. As Jenny says, ""You're my best friend. You do stupid stuff. I sort it out. This is our thing, it's the thing that we do.""

Lindsey Kelk's pop culture and smooth writing style make for easy, light reading. I love when a book takes me to different places in the world like New York, London, Hollywood, Vegas, and Paris. It's fun to read Angela's perception of the different cities. It's safe to say I am sticking with this series and can't wait to read the next two.

Books_5,negative,truthful,"Meh....

If you have nothing to do some afternoon, or are on a flight from NYC to Chicago with a Philly layover, you could do worse. I suppose.  I will give Heller the latitude to play with grammar, punctuation, and sentence structure in the narration, until it becomes clear the narrator is an English major with literary pretensions doing a self-conscious and bad Hemingway imitation. That part is just painful.

Ok, most of this novel has a brisk plot, so WTH not play along? Well because by the end of the afternoon, or flight, you might find you have just spent 4 hours sitting in a kid's basement swapping fever dreams about what you would each do if there was this awesome, crazy really gross disease that like totally destroys the world but it really doesn't but you know it almost does and it still might, you know? but you had like wicked cool weapons AND A PLANE!!!! Oh and a hot chick, don't forget about the hot chick, Dude.

""Yeah, dude, I would so have a plane, you can find hot chicks in PLANES over burning cities or undiscovered canyons, dude.""  AWESOME, DUDE!!!! Fist pumps.  ""I would so totally have a plane , dude.""

So if you have noting much to do, and are willing to sit between Wayne and Garth for a few hours, no problem.  But in no way is this book even remotely comparable to The Road."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"This historical thriller revolves around the Earl of Walden and his family, who all become involved in a life and death struggle the outcome of which could have a serious influence on World War 1.

Walden receives a visit from Churchill, asking for help negotiating with Russia about alliances in the forthcoming War.  Walden feels this is an exciting opportunity to further his career, whilst his Russian wife finds it brings back unwanted memories of a love she has tried to put behind her.  Meanwhile their daughter is busy thinking about being presented to the King and Queen and her first Season  whilst beginning to discover that the real world is not quite as her sheltered upbringing has led her to believe.

Alongside the family activities in London and at their country estate,  the suffragettes are fighting for womens rights, a Russia anarchist has arrived to assassinate the Russian delegate Walden is negotiating with, and interesting discussions are being held on the moving of European boundaries to satisfy political needs.

I found this book disappointing.  The writing style, as usual with Ken Follett, is excellent, and the story moves along at a steady pace.  However I never found myself particularly interested in the main characters.  Many of the historical detail from that time are fascinating ; the social norms of aristocratic women, the suffragettes and the political upheavals going on.  So, its a nice easy read, with interesting background information."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"To being with, it's very important that we pay attention to the exact subtitle of this book-this is ""vampiric"" erotica, not ""vampire"" erotica.  While all of the stories revolve in some way around parasitic characters, only a few of them are the classic warm-thick-blood-sex vampire erotica.  Most of the stories are at least creepy, and a few are quite scary.

As wth any collection of short stories, not every story will be to every person's taste, as you can see from the reviews here.  In particular, the story ""The Dripping of Sundered Wineskins"" seems to elicit a love-it-or-hate-it opinion.  Personally I loved it.  I enjoyed all of the straight vampire tales, especially, of course, Neil Gaiman's excellent opening tale, ""Snow, Glass, Apples"".  Other notable vampire stories were ""Ceilings and Sky"", Whispers in Walled Tombs"", ""First Date"", and ""Bloodlight.""

Unfortunately, though, there are several stories I hated, too.  ""Armies of the Heart"" was one, and I really, really hated ""When Memory Fails"" and ""The Fly Room.""  Eyeball-sucking?  Little mouths hanging around where they shouldn't be? Yeuch, no thank you!  And ""Bela's Plot"" I unfortunately just did not understand.  Were there actual vampires, or just sadists?

All in all, the book is worth it if you like spooky stories, and many of them are written in a slow-moving and descriptive style that gives them an erotic feel, but if you're looking for Vampire Erotica, you won't find much of it here."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"I've never read a book that so completely makes a mountain out
of a molehill of non-existent ""evidence."" This book requires
dozens of traitors to be involved(Marshall, Stark, etc. etc.), unless Stinnet thinks FDR
was intercepting and decoding those msgs by his fireside using a English-Japanese dictionary and a copy of the Japanese codes.
The evidence is absolutely overwhelming  and incontrovertible , both from participants as well as Japanese witnesses interviewed
after the war that the author of this book is out to lunch, and trying to make a quick buck with a lurid tale. Even the logic of
allowing the US fleet to be caught unaware makes no sense whatsoever - if the Japanese bomb Pearl arbor, whether it's ready or not, that means war. FDR would have gained absolutely nothing by allowing the attack to succeed. It also could have been far worse had the attack destroyed the fuel farms, which they would have except for Nagumo's trepidation. And that would have put the Pacific Fleet back on the West Coast and immobile for a year. Nor was their any reason to believe that Hitler would declare war on the US as a result, as claimed. The Japanese didn't go to war with Russia (which Hitler strongly wished) just because Japan's partner Germany had. So how is war with Japan going to result in a war with Germany? It depended on Hitler, who had no good reason to declare war on the US. He was stupid to have done so."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"As a reader who is not an aficionado of speculative fiction or alternative historical fiction, this novel left me rather perplexed. Having read Robert Harris Fatherland a number of years ago (and having enjoyed it) and spurred by the popularity of the Amazon TV series inspired by Dicks novel, I dove in.

Set in an alternate post-WWII America that has been divided by the victorious Japanese and Nazis, the narrative focuses on five or six characters whose stories never quite coalesce; the fragmented narrative structure in itself is not necessarily a flaw (plenty of good novels feature fragmented narratives), but in Dicks novel, it definitely creates a lack of coherence that ultimately enervates the novel. More than half the book is devoted to exposition, but the payoffwhich doesnt really emerge until the final three chapters or so, once again in very fragmented fashionfeels uncertain and anticlimactic. Complicating matters is a novel within the novel, an alternate history that presumes the Allies had won the war but is itself different from the actual historical record (e.g., FDR did not serve four terms as President). Excerpts from this novel, called The Grasshopper Lies Heavy, along with the I Ching, which every character seems to consult for guidance, appear throughout the story, yet again these elements fail to add any sort of coherence to the narrative.

Perhaps my lack of expertise in this genre handicaps my appreciation of this novel (which did, after all, win the Hugo Award), but I was, in the end, disappointed."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"Like any film instructor, I'm always seeking an affordable text for my students. With the average text hovering around $80.00 (and then the additional charge for supplemental books), The Lean Forward Moment seemed like a steal. I say ""seemed"" because like many reviewers here, I'm a bit confused as to whom the target-audience is.

The simple, jargon-free language appeals to the lay-person (which is always welcome in texts geared toward the masses); however, the structure and more advanced concepts give the feel of an academic text. The Lean Forward Moment seems stuck in a perplexing gray-zone. While I feel Hollyn was attempting to please both audiences, he may have (accidentally) alienated both. Curious.

I know that it seems superficial, but one of the ways I evaluate the potential success of a film-text, is through its examples. I know (for a fact) that my students excitedly scan a text ... looking for stills from works they know/love. The Lean Forward moment uses many popular (and technically masterful) examples. The Matrix, Finding Nemo, 300, Lord of the Rings, The Godfather -- all good choices to get the cinema-neonate involved. On the flip side, Across the Universe, Brazil, Synecdoche, Contempt, Coons, Jack in the Box, Satacracy 88 -- these niche/obscure works are interesting to more advanced students (maybe). (And, now we're back to that gray-zone ...).

Here's my professional opinion, The Lean Forward Moment is fantastic for the intermediate student who knows the fundamentals, will be entertained by familiar examples, and is curious about lesser known works."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"Up to now, the only things Bill O'Reilly have ever been good at are weak-minded thought manipulation and noise pollution, but now he has another box to tick off on his resume: he can write humor. Unintentional humor, that is. You see, the garbage that is ""The No-Spin Zone: Confrontations with the Powerful and Famous in America"" proves that even on the page, Bill O'Reilly shines through as a complete hypocrite, and a horrible, horrible writer. It's so bad it's funny. Or it would be funny if people didn't actually listen to and believe this man.

You can see it in print as clearly as on his shows: this guy pulls words out of the mouths of the people he interviews; he bullies them with his stupid questions that are engineered to cater to his own views... And he is never after the truth, because the truth is a gray area and he only sees in black and white. Because he grew up rich and went to a boys' private Catholic school, he likes to think of himself as some kind of supreme arbiter over everyone. People like him are the reason many people think of the USA a ""bratty teenager of a country"". If you are looking for a book that is ""Fair and balanced"", this is most definitely not it. And really, I am not overly into politics, but I know that by supporting this travesty of a man and his pushy attitude the United States of America is sending the world the wrong kind of message."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"I really hated Annabel's family with all my tiny heart and soul. And I did not understand why Annabel just didn't go work in the fields by herself and leave her family to their own devices. That was really odd and kind of annoying.

Other than that, this book was decent enough. It's not the worst one I've ever read. I think there could have been a lot less bashing-you-over-the-head-with-religion, as in, it could have been much more subtly (and thus skillfully) done.

Stephen's character could have been fleshed out a lot more. He was kind of just in the background for most of the time, and so the part that focused on him didn't have as much impact as it could have. I like le Wyse and I liked Annabel, but their relationship was a little ""eh."" I loved Eustacia but thought she talked like Yoda. Most of the language in this book was a little weirdly done. I get that the author was trying to evoke the 1300s, but she didn't pull it off unfortunately. It just came off weird and it was very distracting to read the characters talk like normal people and then say ""Nay."" It reminded me of that John Pinette sketch ""I say nay nay!""

I thought the storyline with the baliff was well done, though I could have lived without Gilbert and Adam's characters. Same with Beatrice - did that actually have a point or not really?

This is a good, light read for when you just need a book that doesn't require your brain to function."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"When Roger Depue was growing up on the east side of Detroit in the late thirties, it was full of Southerners seeking assembly line work at the automobile factories.  His father was a sharpshotter police officer and the places they lived sound a lot like those I lived in as a child.  He had four brothers, all sharing the same bedroom.

In the sixth grade, he played Jesus in the Easter Passion play at his Catholic school and was on the cross.  This left a deep impact on him, as he always felt Jesus' sacrifice was bravery in action for the greater good.

He reached far beyond his father's law career by becoming chief of the FBI Behavioral Science Unit (a profiler to find serial killers) and spent forty years in law enforcement.  He worked as consultant on the Martha Moxley murder in Mass. and JonBenet Ramsey in Boulder.  His specialty was finding society's most depraved, brutal criminals.

After four decades of staring into the darkness of evil, when his wife of 32-years died, he entered a seminary for three years to search for the good and became a Brother of the Society of the Missionaries of the Holy Apostles Seminary in Cromwell, Conn.

His son, Steven, became a deputy for the Fairfax County, Virginia, police.

Roger earned a BS degree in psychology, Masters in society and law, and PhD in counseling and development from American University.  He was a consultant on the movie, 'Silence of the Lambs, starring Anthony Hopkins.

Books_5,negative,truthful,"I think this book would have set better expectations if it had been titled something more along the lines of:
Thinking your way to riches: How to focus your mind and actions to achieve riches.

Since the book is called ""The Science of..."", I was caught off guard when it COMPLETELY ignored the scientific method, making statements such as ""mathematically guaranteed"" when talking about achieving your goals.

I'm a religious person, and can appreciate the role of faith and positive thinking, but I didn't appreciate the tone of the book, that felt more like it was trying to brainwash me, than teach me.  I don't particularly mean brainwash in a bad way, but look at the techniques the book uses: It starts by talking up at great length how great it's main idea is going to be, repeats its positive goals over and over, tells you to control your thinking, and then to disassociate yourself from anyone or anything that thinks differently.  Don't get me wrong, that I think that positive thinking is powerful, and that the message of the book is a good one.  I just think that the book would have resonated more with me if it had been written in a more direct or scientific manner--particularly given it's title.  The 2 stars rating is also because it doesn't particularly have any fantastic insights, it's just motivational.

Books_5,negative,truthful,"Perhaps it was bad luck for V. Hislop that I came to this book immediately after Michael Chabon's Telegraph Avenue - now there's someone whose characters zing off the page, from whose pen flows effortlessly great prose and who can put together a damned good story. None of  which, sadly, applies to Ms Hislop. OK, so I might have been dazzled by Telegraph Avenue, but I think that even if I'd read The Thread close on the heels of say, a thoroughgoing perusal of the phone book, the latter would shine by comparison. I think that Ms Hislop intended The Thread to be a peon to Thessaloniki which is, I'll grant her, a great little city. But it never comes to life; if there is such a thing a taxidermic prose, Ms Hislop can do it. Poor old Thessaloniki is just a one-dimensional sketch under her hand, a stage set about which she poses a cast of cliched cardboard cutouts (the Nazi's mouth is 'thin' - aren't they always? - the protagonist's bad husband is fat and smelly; the university students are all intellectual firebrands. Etc etc). There are far better books than this about this area and this period. For example, anyone who wants a great fictional account of the sack of Smyrna should read Jerusalem Poker (Edward Whittemore), or Middlesex (Jeffrey Eugenides) or Birds without Wings (Louis de Berniers) while Alan Furst's Spies of the Balkans brings pre-war and wartime Thessaloniki beautifully alive in a way that Ms Hislop could only dream about. Don't waste your time with this book. Read something good."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"Reading through the different reviews here, you'd think this guy were Isaac Newton, Leonardo da Vinci and Wolfgang Mozart rolled into one.  Let me think of the simplest way to say this:  he's not.
The storyline was original, that's for sure.  And his emotion is raw.  He definitely has his finger on the pulse of something - although what exactly that is (misdirected youth?  the refusal to accept that people usually _earn_ money?) is sometimes muddled.
But the delivery is poor.  I found it cutesy and contrived.  He relies on the same old gag structure again and again - that one line delivered at the very end to set the last three pages' worth of diatribe on its ear:  ""You just missed your exit"".  ""The wallet was there the whole time.""  and so on.  Add that to the fact that the timeline was impossible to follow, and that the technique of alternating paragraphs between two different time periods does not a gifted writer make, and this presentation had serious flaws.
Unrestrained by literary devices such as plot, he goes on to present a convoluted ""three years [I think it was three years although time flow was truly warped] in the life of"" stream-or-consciousness (whoops I meant ""stream OF consciousness"") story of his recent life.
What's he getting at?  Is he misdirected?  Uninspired?  Lazy?  All of the above?  Am I supposed to admire this?  Is this the role-model of the 21st century?  For the story to be potent, I think it needed a sharper edge."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"I enjoyed this book, but the first half was dull compared to the second half. I felt like Duane spent too much time making inside jokes, displaying ""cute"" aspects of wizardry (I don't think I can forgive her for ""WizPod,"" still), and name-dropping about a bajillion previous characters so we wouldn't forget about them before they became completely unimportant to the plot. I did like where it led, though--to the terrifying transformation of Nita's partner Kit into a tool of his previous Martian incarnation, and I liked how Nita didn't lose her cool when she was scared and had to rescue Kit.

Despite being about aliens, I saw a disappointing side of ""human"" nature reflected in the two transplanted Martian cultures refusing to give up their desire to fight each other--it was what they lived for and what they died for. Nita and Kit finally acknowledging some of their attraction was nice, though I would have been just as happy to see a special partnership that was close and nearly sacred WITHOUT being romance. And I thought it was odd that Duane spent so much time focusing on stuff Dairine was doing without actually mixing it into the plot's finale. She usually finds a way to do that, and instead all we've gotten was a side trip to build up what will probably pay off in the next book. I was also a bit uncomfortable as I read about Kit's older sister Helena . . . I don't remember her from previous books, and felt like she was grafted into the family along with a history that I don't remember being mentioned before."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"I was interested in this book because of the uncommon setting of St. Louis--a city I love, but one that is definitely falling apart. That decay is beautifully described by Franzen. There's no doubt that the prose in 'The Twenty-Seventh City' nearly always sparkles and only occasionally falls flat, usually when he gets too caught up in his philosophical meanderings inside the head of Martin Probst (who is quietly and slowly lovable). There are so many artful descriptions and astute retellings of every-day occurrences to propel readers. Unfortunately, the interesting premise never expands much beyond its setup in the first 50 pages. S. Jammu and her comrades are interesting, but haughty, and their reasons for taking on their twisted plot are never clarified beyond vague sketches of their activist and corrupted pasts. EVERYone in high society, apparently, enters into either physical or intellectual affairs, which often defy their characterisations, and there are so many characters that are highlighted in their dull everyday routines just to service their importance in the book's ending that it drags down the beginning in middle. And when the climax of a 500-page novel hinges on the outcome of a referendum vote... well, I think that's all that needs to be said about that.
Still, Franzen's observations on our every day lives and interactions are shocking in their familiarity, and he undeniably has a good grip on many facets of how our society and culture functions. Twenty years after the fact his comments are still relevant. 'The Twenty-Seventh City' is worth reading, but only if read quickly; labouring over it and its blunted intricacies is not worth the time."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"If you are interested in learning what happens at sea when boredom, monotony, ennui  and endless accounts of filler material taken from every one of the good, action packed adventures that began this series then this is the book for you. I happen to like learning what a day may have looked like at sea in that era but not to the extent that it is all that we learn about over all the pages except the last thirty when the action begins but is broken with an abrupt ending. Of course the action resumes where it left off at the beginning of the next book. In what is rapidly becoming a dissatisfying series, this is the supreme example of dissatisfaction up to this point in my opinion. As usual, I cant fault the writing but the point of this story seems to have been to sell one more book no matter the consequences of not providing an entertaining story. When I first read this series I thought every one of them was a masterpiece of naval historical work. Now that Ive been hooked by the genre, I can say many more recent writers have exceeded these last few books in story telling quality. Two that immediately come to mind are Dewey Lambdin and Jay Worrell. From the same timeframe when OBrian was writing, I value Dudley Popes work more highly. Considering my lack of memory of what the rest of the series holds I hope my opinion of these last few books is dispelled by those remaining. Like the last book, you could completely skip this one without losing anything in the overall storyline."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"I think like many book series, you can't start mid-series. I read many glowing reviews of this book and most of them mention the previous books. Coming into this fresh (I'd not heard of Joe R. Lansdale), the characters and the plot seemed very thin, although the earlier books probably established these elements. When I first started the book, it seemed like a strange amalgam of political correctness, graphic violence, and Fletch-like irreverence. As the story progresses, however, dreadful scene piles on dreadful scene until the book comes across as truly sadistic.

There is an ugly American (Billy) who seeks to humiliate a Mexican girl in the most unpleasant and crude matter. The reader endures many pages of this behavior. I suppose these scenes are intended to justify Hap and Leonard brutally assaulting this guy again and again and again. Finally, Hap literally spreads his own feces on Billy's face, beats him, and makes him stand in the corner. And then does it again. This comes in a scene right after our ""heroes"" discover a girl that's been dismembered with a machete. The reader is treated to an explanation of where the individual pieces of the girl are located about the hotel room. The graphic violence continues up until the final chapter of the novel.

Oh, did I mention that the book opens with a brutal beating of another girl whom Hap saves?  Unfortunately for the girl, Hap doesn't save her until after she's been repeatedly raped, had her face ""stomped in,"" her nipple bitten off, jaw crushed, teeth knocked out, and lost an eye.

Wow. Is this a fun read? I guess it's not my cup of tea."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"This book's biggest accomplishment is reminding one what a great work of art Nabakov's masterpiece is.

My main problem with Tampa was that the main character did come across as a believable human being.  Whereas Humbert Humbert for all his deviant predilections was often a relateable  character, Celeste, the sexual-predator narrator and overwhelmingly dominant figure of Tampa, struck me as a one note, sex-addled sociopath; all the other characters in the book are too peripheral to engage much of the reader's attention.

Tampa is filled with detailed and uninteresting sex scenes.  The main interest is wondering how Celete's downfall will be brought about.  I hoped Celeste's ensuing public disgrace and trial to turn to a Bonfire of the Vanities type spectacle but that section of the book apparently occupied little of the author's attention because it sped by perfunctorily.

I was drawn to Tampa initially by enthusiastic reviews in credible sources such as Slate.  I wonder if much of this enthusiasm was the result of the phenomenon of male critics being automatically wowed and over impressed when female artists frankly address female sexuality (cf. Liz Phair).  Lisa Zeidner's review in the Washington Post (available online as of this writing) seemed a more accurate assessment of Tampa.

One may wonder why I gave Tampa even three stars.  First of all, I'm a generous grader when it comes to books.  Second of all, it did contains several humorous passages and passages of well wrought writing.  Third of all, despite its flaws, I'll remember it.  Lastly the author deserves some credit for daring the comparison to a canonical masterwork and inspiring one to reread its literary inspiration."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"Silly me, I figured that after so many reviewers' complaints about  Hutch being stuck behind a desk in the last couple novels, the author was going to make his (and Priscilla's) many fans happy by writing a story of her early years.  Made sense to me, as it seemed an easy way to get our favorite female star ship pilot back in the pilot's seat and give us an exciting and engrossing story, like the first awesome books in this series.

But no, I was wrong.  As soon as Hutch graduates and receives her pilot's license, the author puts her...wait for it...behind a desk.  Really?  I waited 2 years and paid $11 so I could see her behind a desk again?  Oh, sure enough, later on she does get to fly again, but not as the ""pilot in charge"" and she never gets to do anything even remotely interesting, much less daring or exciting.  For the most part, any time she's flying it's under the command of someone else, and it's the someone else that makes the decisions comes up with the solutions to the problems of the day.  Hutch's presence adds virtually nothing to the story; it would be the same if Joe the no-name boring starship pilot took her place.

Let's try to be clear: Mr. McDevitt - We LOVE the old Hutch, the one in the pilot's seat.  The one who explored strange new worlds, who made decisions, who took risks; the one without whom all would be lost.  PLEASE bring her back.  I think if you write one more ""Hutch behind a desk"" story I may have to give up on you."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"I didn't like this book and I didn't like Sally Mann.  It was the most boring book I have read in a long time.  First of all, she really puts a great emphases on how smart she supposedly is.  She includes notes from elementary, high school and college teachers.  Pardon me while I yawn.

  This book is interspersed with photos, copies of notes and letters, and anything Mann throws in to make herself look good.  Her notoriety comes from the nude photos she took of her children growing up.  Many people found them sexually suggestive.  I found them exploitive but not really offensive.  Mann spends time defending herself on the photos calling herself nave time and time again.  That's OK for awhile but it gets tiresome when she doesn't smarten up at all.  She is shocked that pedophiles are interested in them. Really?

  She also separates the pictures from the children.  She says the children are merely actors in the pictures and can keep the two separate identities apart even the 6 year old. Then she goes on to say how nice it is to have pictures of their childhood.  Which is it?  Are they separate or true depictions?

  After that she goes on to explore past relations.  She discusses her husband's parents murder/suicide.  Then she goes on to discuss kinfolk in even the more distant past.  This is when I lost complete interest and just thumbed through the rest of the book's pictures.  By then I was so turned off that I didn't even enjoy them.

  This was definitely not the book for me."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"Ahh...such a pretty cover that contains a book that is really nothing special.  But, I've read the Vampire Kisses series by Schrieber, so I was kind of expecting it.

I actually liked Celeste and I liked Brandon.  Celeste is different than the typical teenager in her crowd.  It stands out right from the beginning.  She goes with the flow because it's the easy thing to do.  She didn't want to loose her friends by rocking the boat.  I wasn't surprised by it.  I also liked how Brandon is different.  He doesn't fit it with either crowd.  It's especially interesting when we learn about his life at his previous school.  I also like the chemistry between Celeste and Brandon, that is until it got a little over the top.  It's like an inevitable part of teen fiction sometimes.

I wasn't particularly found of Celeste's friends.  They seemed so shallow.  And Nash was just not likable at all.  I was expecting a love triangle type of things.  But, Nash was hard for me to swallow.  I also didn't really like the town divided thing.  It just didn't work with the story in my eyes.  The actual legend of the werewolf was different.  It was really tame compared to other stories.  But, then again it fits into the author's idea of vampires in her other series.

So, will I read the next one?  I'm not sure.  This was ok, but it didn't really stand out in any way.  But, the author's other series did get progressively better with each book, so I might give the next installment a go."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"The story was absoulutly horrible and on a rating from one to ten, it would be a negative five.  It would not be worth a cent, to even a book deprived orphan.
  For starters, it has no plot, whatsoever.  The closet thing to a plot that can be found, if you have the time and patience to look, it that, if your a mermaid, don't be annoying.
  For the mermaid in the story is beyond annoying.  She gets to the point that you just want to wring her scaly neck.  She talks back, is stubburn and rude.  And yet the two main characters in the story LIKE her!
  The story starts with these two incredibally boring girls who (fortunatly) are moving away from each other, soo.  I don't know if I could stand another sentance of ""I'll miss her so much"" or ""I wish I could go back in time.""

  But all bad things can't last for forever, much to my pleasure, and the mermaid goes back to the sea, before dieing from lack of salt (booo!!!).  Then, in the end, the guy must turn into a fish, or something, because he goes out to live witht he mermaid.  They should have just had the mermaid into a fish fillet.

At that point then, since there's a lot of book left, the plot must follow the police closing in on the killer and an exciting finish.

That's what's absent from elevating this book above the pack. Otherwise, it's not awful, it's just no better or worse than the other tripe out there that serves as a backdrop permitting us to identify better work.  And distasteful, as well as not credible, bits like Kate's having her coffee handground by an ancient Chinese woman (must be about 150 years old she opines) on an ancient handgrinder (or perhaps it's driven by a waterwheel) that she opines must be about 250 years old. Oh daahling, ratherrr!  Puh-leeze!

Actions speak louder than words so my action on the murderer being revealed midway though and then the plodding pace the plot then takes was to skip to the end to see if perhaps there was some twist inserted in the interim pages that resulted in someone else being the murderer. Nope. Instead, through an incredible plot device, the murderer instead comes to them and is about to shoot them when someone dives forward, windowglass shatters as simultaneously others enter the room and the murderer is off balance when the gun goes off.  Hmm, never heard of that happening in a mystery before.  What makes that device work is when the pacing just carries you along, otherwise it's a yawner at the end."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"Rotters is definitely a novel of unique content and fresh ideas, but the story felt more like a one-trick pony than a creative masterpiece. Kraus has honed his chops on lesser-length works and some of the stress of a full novel shows in his pacing and plotting: full bore for dozens of pages and ploddingly dull for dozens more. The corporeal and detailed sub-culture of grave robbers is splendidly realized, and the players are mostly intriguing if dull. Joey's experiences at school and at the hands of students and teachers alike are far too over the top to be believeable in any real sense. The villain of the story goes through so many self-mutilations, that he too, becomes just another unbelievable movie villain in the vein of Jason or Freddy instead of Anton Chigurh. At its condensed heart, Rotters just wasn't very interesting to me. It was like a sideshow exhibit where at first glance, you're wowwed, but the novelty wears off quickly and boredom sets in. At one point, Joey breaks his father's shovel handle. There is an entire monologue and a continuing story arc about how this incredible instrument had been with him for 20 years and had to be thrown away. The spade is the tool, not the handle. You wouldn't toss your favorite instrument because it needed a new shaft. You'd get a new one and keep using it. This book is the same way. The focus was far too prevalent on the handle, and much less on the part that mattered most. On a parting note, as a parent, this is definitely not for kids. Though targeted toward teens, the language is vile and content morbidly graphic. I'd never recommend this to a 14-year old."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"I bought this book on the strength of the reviews I read in Amazon, and all I can guess is that these reviewers are friends of the author because this is not a good book at all. My nine year old daughter and I read it together and she was very upset by the constant ridiculing of Elsie, the fact that the author had to restate over and over again what a freak she was, as fat as a circus act, can't look at her feet, has multiple chins, etc.  Okay, we get it, she's fat!  Now can we get on to the humanity of the child?  The other girls, including the narrator, were unlikeable for so long that we almost didn't care when they started to realize Elsie was a person with feelings.  And my daughter was very concerned with Elsie's mother's abuse of her, and very much hoping the mother would come to some kind of understanding of her daughter by the end.  I read the last two chapters before she did, and when I told her that no such event occurred she refused to read the end of the book.
As a writer myself, I was disappointed by the author's lack of a grip on story structure.  The characters had very little arc, and there were no likeable characters to relate to.  In addition, the utterly terrifying chapter where the children are kidnapped by a truck driver and taken outside the city limits has no place in a book like this.  Nor did the slap on the wrist outcome by the police.  My daughter also was very confused by this.
I respect the opinions of those who liked this book, but I couldn't disagree more."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"My theory is fiction writers (especially regarding their first novel) is analogous to my theory on psychiatrists.  Every psychiatrist I know has gone into the profession to learn more about their own particular psychosis.  Likewise, every author writes his first novel to exorcise his secret fantasies.  If this is indeed the case, Schickler is one messed up dude.

Each story is about a character's search for a lover and ultimately acceptance the taciturn landscape of a Manhattan apartment building - the Preemption.  We are introduced to each character in terms of their principal personal flaw, be it physical or emotional.  (What is Schickler's own personal flaw?  Perhaps he had both an unsightly birthmark and total insecurity about a childhood loss).  Each of these flaws is at the core of Schickler's stories.  The stories focus on the pursuit of the opposite sex.  We eavesdrop on each characters fantasies and insecurities.  (I think Schickler must secretly desire to order a gorgeous travel writer into his jalopy).  One thing is for certain, Schickler idolizes beautiful women.  Every woman in the book is gorgeous and lubricious.  The most developed character (and thus - according to my theory - the character most closely resembling Schickler) is a stock trader with deviant sexual practices that I won't reveal (suffice to say Schicker's dates had better be suspicious of nice diners).

In the end, Kissing in Manhattan is clearly Schickler's own little personal fantasy with names changed to protect the innocent.  It's a book about losers scoring the knockout babe, about dazzling women allowing themselves to be dominated by eccentric men, and ultimately about ONE man's quest to find sexual satisfaction and acceptance of his personal shortcomings.  That man's name is David Schickler."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"The author, a secularist, does not bother to treat philosophical arguments for God's existence seriously. For example, he lauds Bertrand Russell's attack on the cosmological argument (p. 185) when, in fact, Russell created a straw man. In ""Why I am Not a Christian,"" Russell says that cosmological arguments all fail because they depend on this premise:

P1: Everything that exists has a cause

Or order to reach this conclusion along with one more premise:

P2: The universe exists.
-------------
C1: Therefore, the universe has a cause (God)

But Russell claims that C1 (God) would be subject to P1. God would require a cause for God's existence. If so, the argument fails.

This is absurd because I have never read a version of the cosmological argument (in 35 years of studying and teaching and writing about philosophy of religion) that used this argument premise. Of course, P1 will defeat a cosmological argument, but no one uses it!

For example, the kalam cosmological argument reasons this way:

P1: What every begins to exist, has a cause of its existence.
P2: The universe began to exist.
-----------
C1: Therefore, the universe has a cause (God).

Notice that the kalam's P1 differs radically from Russell's version: ""Everything that exists has a cause."" God, of course, did not (by definition) begin to exist, so is not subject requiring a beginning cause for God's existence. In order words, there is no reductio ad absurdum. Neither do the Thomistic or the Lebinizian cosmological arguments rely on Russell's manufactured premise.

One could go on about the cosmological argument (I devote 30 pages to it in my book, Christian Apologetics), but suffice to say that this book does not bother to critique the argument at its best, only at its worst.

That is a very bad sign indeed, but I find that many British secular philosophers are often dismissive of philosophical theism. Shame on them."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"Adam Schonberg is in medical school and trying to make ends meet without the support of either his or his wife, Jennifer's, parents.  His family was not happy when he married outside the Jewish religion.  Now he finds that their already struggling family of two is about to be a family of three and he doesn't know how to cope or manage financially.  Jennifer will have to quit her job as a dancer and so Adam decides to take a leave of absence from medical school to go work for a drug company.  But all is not what it seems with their fancy corporate headquarters and high dollar paychecks.  Adam soon finds himself in the middle of a corporate plan to take over the field of medicine by drugging and mind controlling as many doctors as the company can get their hands on.  All the while, Adam must deal with the conflict developing between Jennifer and himself because of his suspicions that her OBGYN is drugged as well.

Cook weaves an extremely interesting conspiracy theory about how the business world is beginning to affect medicine and it's treatment, or lack thereof, of patients.  It confronts the  idea that for-profit companies will continue to have an influence on the field of medicine that is not always as positive as these companies would lead you to believe.  The unfortunate aspect of this book was that the story line jumped from idea to idea a bit and often portrays Jennifer in a overly simplistic and patronizing manner.  Just when the adventure really heats up, the story ends abruptly and rather predictably.  A story with a lot of potential ended flat and in disappointment.  Still, one still finishes with the contemplation that Cook intended."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"This was an interesting book.  There were parts that ran a little dry for me, as a duffer who knows next to nothing about neuroscience.  It was very accessible, easy to understand and follow; if anything, the dry parts were due to more depth than I needed.  But it simply showed the author's careful adherence to due diligence, offering solid evidence for the conclusions she drew.  The writing was clear and professional and easy to read; there were a couple of very fun optical illusions in the early chapters, and I wish there had been more visuals, more images and graphics, for the reader's sake, but such would be unnecessary; merely fun.

I was fascinated by the concept of the book, that optimism is a necessary and beneficial adaptation in our species, provided it doesn't go too far.  I am a former and still occasional optimist, of the type that went too far; I smoked for more than fifteen years, somehow managing to ignore the obvious damage I was doing to myself, and the fact that two of my grandparents died of tobacco-influenced lung cancer.  Because surely those things wouldn't happen to young, strong me!  Surely the damage that smoking does to a person was mitigated by my own magnificence and dumb luck!  As I have aged, however -- and particularly as I have spent the last dozen years trying to teach English to American teenagers in a public school -- my optimism has decreased markedly.  But it was in some ways very inspiring to me to read about the benefits of continued *reasonable* optimism, especially coming from a scientist rather than a self-help snake oil salesman.  I believe I will try to look on the bright side -- but not be blinded by it."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"Elmore Leonard has been inordinately successful getting his books adapted to the screen. Justified, the TV show based on the character Raylan Givens from Pronto, Riding the Rap, and the short story Fire in the Hole (the last adapted for the Justified pilot), is as good as any Leonard adaption. Seeing his characters with such incredible life breathed into him had to have spurred Leonard return to Givens.

Unfortunately, Leonard chose to tell a story in parallel to season 2 of Justified, allowing the show's writers to view early manuscripts. Raylan is composed of three major plotlines (almost three novellas loosely tied together). Two of those plotlines were featured heavily in season 2 of Justified. It's not that they hew so closely to the show that they bore the reader, it's that, in my opinion, Justified did them better. Boyd, in particular, is a far more compelling character on the show. Most other characters get far more time in the show to be developed. Raylan works much better when it departs from the stories told by the show.

I take as poor a view of mining companies as Leonard does, but the coal plotline gets a bit preachy. Again, Justified better captures the inner conflict of people in coal country--a desperate need for jobs and a deep-seated desire to be left alone by and distrust of outsiders.

If you're more of a casual Leonard fan who has seen Justified, I would recommend reading another Leonard novel next. If you're a diehard Justified fan looking for an introduction to Justified, I would recommend another Leonard novel, perhaps Riding the Rap or Pronto (neither of which I have read, although I've read Fire in the Hole). If you've read most of Leonard's work, love Justified, and have read Leonard's earlier work featuring Givens, then you probably will enjoy this book."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"Djilas was among the top leaders of the new emerging Yugoslav Republic after the Second World War. His voyages to Moscow were of extreme importance to Yugoslavian communists and for himself also. His very detailed accounts of his encounters with the leaders of Soviet Union are very interesting, but after his final visit, he begins to view things differently. I can say that I understand his point of view, but I can also  understand Moscow's attitude as well. If we are scientific enough to reject calling Soviet Union as ""imperialist"" I can move on, if not well...I do not call Soviet Union ""imperialist"" and place myself in their position. As regards to the Soviet Union the war took its toll immensely, the victory was won with awful consequences. One has  to be guarded as regards to foreign policy, one also has to think about his country and revolution primarily. When Djilas complains to Stalin about Red Army soldiers' bad behaviours, Stalin's answer shows his different perspective (to which I agree). He wants Djilas to understand that in real life things are complicated. He explains that they had to include all the men into the army, including all the convicts,so when a man fights for his life,walks for thousands of miles and sees his best friends die you can not expect him to behave as if nothing has happened. The problem with the writer is that his critics are very reasonable but when they amount to anti-communism they are not satisfactory. Djilas is convicted in Yugoslavia later for writing this book. I do not think he is an agent of imperialism but his works get attention in the West for its anti-communist views. All in all a good book worth reading but has to be supplemented with further readings on the post-war Soviet Union subject."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"I liked it. I didn't love it.

After finishing this book, I tried to determine exactly what I didn't love about it. It took me a moment to put my finger on it. There was an entertaining main character, lots of action, some cool magic, and even a bit of romance. I think the problem was that I didn't connect with the main character.

Harry was so...I don't know. And that's the point. The book is written in Harry's first-person point-of-view, and Harry repeatedly reminds the reader that he is a skilled wizard. He also reminds the reader, on a number of occasions, that those who are privileged to see into his soul are generally shocked or terrified at what they see. Through Harry's accomplishments, I saw that Harry is indeed a skilled wizard. But I never saw what was inside his soul. I want to know about his dark past. I want to know Harry.

On a couple of occasions in the book, Harry claims to struggle with his choices. He wants to do the right thing, but the power of his magic draws him toward darker things. I know about these struggles because Harry told me so explicitly. Never once I did I actually see him make so much as a questionable decision. He did the right thing; he fought for good. So all the rambling in his head about his dark past and about temptation was lost on me. I saw no inner turmoil. I saw only a good guy skilled in magic attempting to fight a powerful, power-hungry evil guy.

Without a backstory, this is a typical good versus evil book. So it didn't blow me away. I will read the second book in this series though, and I hope to see Harry making some tough decisions that show me the darkness he claims is inside him."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"I have mixed feelings about this book. On the one hand I'm sure it will stay with me, if only because it has provided me with a vivid picture of what the mental life of somebody I know may be like. On the other hand I did not care for the writing ...

... starting with the title, whose intriguing promise is not in any way, that I can see, kept, Naturally the title brings to mind Sherlock Holmes. And the connection is indeed drawn in the book, which, very annoyingly to my mind, relates the main plot of the relevant Conan Doyle novel, which I would have been motivated to reread after all these years had it only been alluded to rather than completely revealed (and to no good purpose that I can see). And what does it have to do with THIS novel? Not much. Just about the only plot element that was keeping me interested was the detective mystery, but, bizarrely, this is blown up rather early in the game ... admittedly thereby introducing a different and also intriguing plot element, but not intriguing enough to assuage my disappointment at the demise of the detective element.

The writing is lacking also in that there are contradictions in the text and sometimes the characters do things that I simply could not believe.

The main problem with the writing, though, is one of the things that gives the book its strength, namely, conveying what I presume is an autistic-like mind. Unfortunately the author is not enough of a stylist to prevent me from mentally shouting, OK, enough already, I get it. It became tedious for most of my read.

I will credit the book and story with a strong double message: It shows that some people are capable of unconditional love (and some are not), and happiness is not to be found."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"So, caveat of course - I did stop 1/3 of the way through the book, so it may well redeem itself later and come to a thrilling conclusion. I don't know, because I couldn't make it that far. Also, I think I missed one or more of the earlier books in this series. It seems like that might have been a prerequisite for liking the characters in this one, because none of them appealed to me. Mels, the heroine, was the most likeable but she still didn't grab me; she's stuck in a town she doesn't like and living with her mom and isn't doing anything about it. She's ""daring"" in that she doesn't wear a seatbelt, and nice in that she pays her debts and helps strangers in need, but that's about it. She's not striving for anything and has no greater plan of her own.

The hero and other male characters are all very JRWard-esque strong and uber-male and urban/gangsta, but not in a sexy way and again none of them really grabbed me. I wasn't rooting for anyone and wasn't worried about anyone. Unlike her Black Dagger Brotherhood series where the team is all about saving a community and innocents, in this series the cause (a fight between angels and demons) seems pretty self-centered. There may be some innocent caught in Hell that one of the angels is trying to rescue (again, must have missed that backstory in another book) but overall it seems the protagonists and antagonists are just trying to win a contest set up by the Maker in order to save their own souls.

Anyway - maybe if you read all the books in the series in order, and don't have any expectation of a good romance or quickly paced action, you'd enjoy it. I'll be skipping the rest of this series and waiting for her next."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"Native Tongue is an enjoyable book which translates well to riding a train, something I do every day, an hour each way. The story is crafted well enough to keep you interested, the characters are colorful, the underlying message is a decent one, and the book as a whole stands up well as I look back on it. Having said that, there's something in the narrative which makes you wonder about the author, if he's really a homicidal maniac waiting for you to stumble into his back yard.

That statement might sound a bit off-the-wall. I suppose I should admit to having read a magazine article about him recently. The book moves from colorful, with a hint of darkness, to a little edgy for the wrong reasons after you read more about the guy. Still, that shouldn't (and doesn't) take away from the book, which is a good way to pass the time on the train ride into the city.

The story is about man's encroachment on the various Florida lands that should be reserved for wildlife as opposed to, say, condos and parking lots. To be sure, this is an ever-growing problem which looms on society's horizon, only getting bigger by the day. In typical American fashion, the author takes this stand only *after* establishing his own residence in the state. ""Do as I say, not as a do,"" has never been more prevalent.

But the book isn't terribly serious. It's a whimsical fiction story which is easy to chew through at a good pace. Hiaasen is a good writer, and keeps the narrative moving well through the book. A bit peculiar in spots, the story nevertheless runs cohesively from start to finish, pausing occasionally to let you laugh at yet another silly kink in the story's chain.

All in all, a good book that's worth the read. Will definitely buy more of this author's work."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"What I liked:  Alice in Zombieland is about a girl that finds out that her father wasn't really simply a mental case when he locked the family in at night to protect them from terrible creatures.  The monsters are real, and they're coming, and they will eat you.  Ali is reeling from the tragedy of losing her entire family while adjusting to her new reality where zombies exist and she can now see them.  Teaming up with others at her school, she must fight to prove that she's worthy of sharing their secrets and fighting the good fight.

What I didn't like:  The zombies in Alice in Zombieland are not zombies, but rather some type of soul-eating spirit monsters.  There is little of Alice in Wonderland to be found in this book.  At the beginning, I was under the impression that there would be more, but it quickly devolves to only tangentially related chapter titles and a main character with the same name.  Given that zombies and Alice in Wonderland are the two main reasons I picked the title up, it was a bit of a recipe for disappointment for me.  Also, the insta-love with Cole Holland was ridiculous.  Even though Showalter tried to explain it away with some sort of magical something or another, it turned me off their relationship for a big chunk of the novel.

Final thoughts:  Alice in Zombieland can be enjoyable, if you know what to expect.  Don't come in expecting a retelling of Alice in Wonderland in any form, nor true zombies.  Be prepared for the ridiculously executed insta-love and some heavy melodrama.  If you can handle these things and enjoy the characters, you can find in this novel a quite different take on the teens fighting evil theme.  I'll likely continue the series."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"I like Michael Crichton. A lot. I began a long time ago with the Andromeda Strain and that was a super thriller.

Dragon Teeth is readable, but it is not a stand out and certainly way below the standard that made him one of the most popular author of thrillers.

There are several reasons for this:

1) Crichton is generally excellent in giving you a deep understanding of the issues involved and leaves you enlightened and informed. For example, in Rising Sun he describes exactly how and why the Japanese company's surveillance cameras were superior and why American sleuths could not retrieve relevant images. In Disclosure he describes how the HR department functions and what is involved in cases of allegations of sexual harassment.

Dragon Teeth is supposedly similar with paleontology as the backdrop. I disagree. The background provided is cursory and a fifteen minute read on the topic on Wikipedia will leave you better informed.

2) Crichton is excellent with cliffhangers. Each chapter leaves you waiting to see what happened next. The pace is relentless the climax is tremendous. Dragon Teeth is distinctly ho hum. The descriptions could come from a travel brochure, the characters are not well developed, and there is little to no suspense.

In addition, there are loose ends. I will not say more because this would be a spoiler but one significant character introduced with fanfare leads you to believe that this character plays an important role in the tale. Instead this character then simply vanishes.

3) There are discrepancies which are jarring. For example, he describes the protagonist as having a full, luxuriant mustache. A sentence later he says that he had a clearly visible scar on his upper lip. The two are incompatible. He can have one or the other but not both.

Overall, this is a reasonably good read but not a thriller and nowhere near the standard one would expect from Michael Crichton."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"""Ape House"" is a light read that attempts to open the animal world to us by bringing the Bonobos Apes to life in an original way.

This is a story about a family of Bonobos, their caretaker scientist Isabel Duncan and a down to earth reporter John Thigpen. I will cover the plotting in a few words, it begins with the primate language laboratory being bombed and Isabel left badly injured, severe enough to end up in the trauma ward of the closest hospital. The Bonobos fall into the hands of a porn producer and are locked up in a house with cameras broadcasting their every move on cable television. Reporter John Thigpen covers the story while his personal life is on a down turn, his home life it is about to take a drastic change. The plotting gets meatier when Isabel is released from hospital and teams up with John to find out who targeted the laboratory, for what reason and what has happened to her family of apes.

The story explores in a far-fetched semi captivating manner, the issue of animal rights from the point of view of activists, scientists and the public. The plot takes a meandering course with a bit of action here and there mostly done by the humans, there are also subtle references to sexual activities amongst the apes and their unique methods of communication. I found this part satire and part morality driven tale was presented to us by a cast of lackluster and easily forgotten characters, maybe if the Bonobos had been given a greater role it would have left a more lasting impression. Unfortunately the book started strong just to peter out by the end, I was disappointed when the tale did not capture the apes' behaviour, gestures and emotions in a more detailed fashion.

Although the story was not what I had anticipated, I nevertheless enjoyed the change."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"I could not take this book seriously after I read Chapter 1, The Myth of Calorie Math. The author quotes the study, Energy Density, Portion Size, and Eating Occasions: Contributions to Increased Energy Intake in the United States, 19772006 by Kiyah Duffey and Barry Popkin at the Univ. of NC at Chapel Hill, by saying that the study discovered the number of calories consumed per person per day increased by a jaw-dropping 570 calories between 1977 and 2006. The author of this book then goes on to state that if the average person is consuming 570 more calories than necessary per day and if the calorie-counting math we hear about daily is accurate, then the average person should have gained 476 pounds since 2006.

This is a misleading example and conclusion.  An increase of 570 calories (which I highly doubt in the first place), does not mean that the average person would gain 476 pounds! At some point, the weight gain would level out until the person reached a higher weight. In fact, the Chapel Hill study concluded that the average consumption was close to 2,374 calories/day in 2006 versus 1,803 in 1977. A human being will not weigh over 600 lbs. by eating 2,374 calories/day.

However, I do agree that these calorie studies are inaccurate, but not because calories don't matter, but because they're based on surveys, not science. The U of NC at Chapel Hill study based their information on an earlier study called, The Nationwide Food Consumption Survey (NFCS), 1977-78, which was a telephone survey in which the person with major responsibility for planning or preparing meals reported on foods purchased the last 7 days, food consumption, a list of the people (age/sex) living in the household, and guests (who may have eaten food). Let me ask you, can you tell me how much food was consumed in your household this week? I cant."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"I have never written a review before, but this book irritated me.  Entirely too much internal dialogue.  All 6 books leading up to this one were forward moving, action packed, weaving new sub-plots... not this one.  Like other reviewers I grew really tired of Mac and her immaturity (even though she tried to evolve out of it), and such strong emotions being dumped all together.  The emotional roller coaster finally made me motion sick.  I got really tired of the inside of Mac's head.  Dont ""tell"" me how she feels, ""show"" me how she feels.  And frankly, after 27 pages, i really ""don't give a frog.""  Actually, halfway through the last book I really didn't care what happened to anyone.  Not a good sign after 6 books (which I loved).
I think the series went too long, so the amount of backtracking that had to be done to allow for people who are too lazy to start at the beginning got really tiring.  I felt the for-shadowing for Barrows return was heavy handed so I didn't mourn his death at all, I just thought ""You Idiot!  He TOLD you don't expect things to die!"" and then was frustrated that she didn't hang around and defend his body so it wasn't eaten by the locals. If this was someone I cared so much for, and I thought there was the slightest chance he could come back, i would stand there spear in hand until his head rotted off. Highly unbelievable character actions.
I so loved the Highlander series that I was super happy she wove the characters into this one. I was glad to hear from the MacKeltars and Adam and all them.
In all, I felt the story ended too abruptly, slamming on the brakes and throwing me into the dashboard. I leave the series battered, bruised and sorely needing a dramamine."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"I obtained an advance reader's copy of this book some time ago and had several false starts trying to read it.
My first attempt was on an Orlando to LAX flight - I literally had nothing else to do but open the book and read.
Somehow, I just couldn't get into it.  Some books draw you in and hold on to you even after you're finished.  This is certainly not one of those types of books.

My second attempt was in a car dealer's waiting room.  I opted to wait for my car.  Due to an unexpected delay finding a specific part, my estimates one hour wait turned into a 3 hour wait.  Again, I resumed reading this book yet couldn't manage to make myself turn the pages.  I read a couple more chapters but still couldn't muster enough interest to continue.

Then I find myself on another coast to coast flight, this time in a comfy seat up front.  Near the endpoint of the flight, my seat-neighbor asks me how the book is...I told him that I have tried to read it several times but I can't seem to garner enough interest.  I mentioned that I fell asleep twice trying to force myself to read the pages.  I also told him of my plan to review it on Amazon and that it would not be fair to review the work until I have properly read it.

All of that said, I finally did sit down and read the book.  Yes, the first third seems to plod along.  The book does pick up some, probably because I developed a form of literary Stockholm syndrome being a slave to its pages.

Overall - the novel's plot development is slow.  The characters, and there were too many of them, were not especially memorable for me.  The whole thing was predictable.  I would not recommend this book."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"I purchase this book to flesh out data regarding life in post war Europe.  Having interviewed survivors of the conflict in both eastern and western Europe I was disappointed at the lack of substance and the lack of clarity of the author.  It started with the author's allegation that there is a vast amount of information about Eastern Europe and his intention to portray a balanced look at Europe as a whole.  Surprisingly, the focus continued to be Western Europe with some information regarding Eastern Europe.  For, example is that a crucial piece of data omitted as to the penalty for harboring a Jew in occupied Europe:  Specifically, that only in Poland was a death penalty imposed.  Then, the misrepresentation of facts and eyewitness accounts to fit the author's notions.  For example, Lowe reported soviet atrocities seemingly as portrayed by Nazi propaganda (""...according to the German Captain..."") whilst minimizing Soviet eyewitnesses German atrocities (""...claimed a Read Army soldier..."").  I can go on ad infinitum but will relay an omission of fact.  Upon annexing western Poland into the Reich, the Germans proceeded to deport Polish inhabitants to the General Government area with the vacant house occupied by colonizers.  What could have been an excellent book on the subject of post war struggles to survive turned out to be a book with slanted conclusions as well as selective presentation of facts.

One thing that the author did capture correctly albeit again slanted was the actions of the western soldiers.  We hear of the raping of French colonial troops.  We hear how the Americans paid desperate women for sex (which is a form of rape).  However, we hear that the British soldier were disgusted.  Can it be that Lowe is a British author?  A vast majority of soldiers behave badly in war.  The rarity is the noble soldier who does nothing bad or evil."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"Maisie Dobbs just kept popping up on Amazon lists for months, so I though I'd try it. I was not as impressed as I had expected.  Maisie is able to slave all day as a maid and  read Kant at night.  i find it nearly impossible to believe.  Also, she combines a love of philosophy with psychology, but all her psychology seems not to have any of the sexist and other prejudices which were rampant at the time.  She has powerful friends.  In this book, everyone she meets becomes her friend, which is why it reminds people of Nancy Drew.  There's a lot of interesting history in the book, and its style and pacing are good.  Winspear is trying to make her Maisie a girl who can meet anyone, but that is the least credible part of the book.  Snobbery in England was a national obsession that took a hard blow with the Great War, but didn't die without a lot of other assalults.  At least Winspear references it, but these difficulties are too easily overcome by Maisie and her always right attitude and approach.  Some of the tips on how to make people talk seem odd to me.  Manipulative or new agey or just stuck in to explain why the most stiff  upper lip people would share their family secrets with Maisie.  I will probably read on or two more in the series, because this book had to introduce Maisie nd give her an adventure/mystery/plot to start off the series.  If I have to read about an anachonistic girl superdetective, I'm content with the Mary Russell series by Laurie King.  if i want post WWI mysteries, there is Charles Todd's amazing series.  And if you want old school writing by a woman who was contemporary with the whole WWI era, Dorothy Sayers Lord Peter Wimsey series are usuaaly in print."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"Described as wittily funny and utterly brilliant I found it neither, though it was intriguing, so I stayed with it. The economy has tanked in the U. S. and anarchy is just beginning to bare its ugly teeth. Stan and Charmaine are without jobs or house (they lost it when they could no longer make the payments), and they're living in their car, moving constantly to avoid roaming gangs and sleeping only in snatches. Charmaine does work a few hours in a dive bar; her best friends now are prostitutes who service their customers in the back room. So when Charmaine sees an ad on TV for the Positron Project in the town of Consilience the couples decides they have nothing to lose. They board a bus for the complimentary trip, they're wined and dined and put up in a nice hotelhot showers! fresh bedsheets! wine with dinner! Not everyone gets in, mind you, and Stan and Charmaine go through a series of workshops meant to weed out the undesirables. If they make it, a house in the cute little 50s-era town of Consilience is theirs. The catch? They spend 30 days in the Positron Prison and 30 days as townspeople for the rest of their lives. Because theres no leaving the Project once you sign on the dotted line. The towns motto? Do time now, buy time for our future. Cons + Resilience = Consilience. Yikes. The rest of the novel is a whirl of selective euthanasia and sex robots and Elvis impersonators and an attempted escape to Las Vegas, of all places! That, and some sort of sex imprinting brain surgery that backfires occasionally, leaving one woman with a fetish for a blue knit teddy bear. The Heart Goes Last is a little bit Truman Show, with a pinch of Stepford Wives and 1984, perhaps. (Heres Atwood talking about the novel on NPR)

Originally written as a serial for the online publisher Byliner, the novel was entertainingbut The Heart Goes Last was no Handmaids Tale. [read more at thisismysymphony."
Books_5,negative,truthful,Kate and her daughter live in a house that is falling apart around them. She was married for five years to an abusive husband. There is a mystery surrounding Joseph's death and his brother Ryan is holding it over her head. I sympathize with the h's that Anderson creates. Her h usually tend to have a handicap or dark past of some kind. The H is usually strong and protective and neither are disloyal or unfaithful to one another. Miranda is an adorable four year old but I have to say Chloe from Silver Thaw has been my favorite up to tis point. Zach McGovern is Katie's neighbor and as hard as Kate tries to keep him away from her and Miranda she finds herself caring for him right under her roof. The relationship between the two is slow at first but when you learn of Kate's first marriage it makes sense. What a nightmare she went through and with Ryan still threatening not just her but violence to her little girl she leans on Zach for protection. That is always my favorite part when the h finally puts her trust in the H. He does not disappoint either. The trouble I had with the book was it's similarities to Silver Thaw. The h in ST was nicknamed Mandy just as the little girl in this read. Chloe refers to the H as Mr. Jeb and Daddy Jeb. Miranda calls the H Mr. Zach and papa Zach. There are legalities to be dealt with in both as well. It is still a good read and the author takes her characters on their journey nice and slow so you really feel the bond between them. The love scenes take a back seat but you will still find it within. The healing and building of trust is the main point that the author drives home topped off with love. If you're looking for a steamy book this book will not fill your need as it shows the softer side of love.
Books_5,negative,truthful,"Macy is bored of all the pitiful looks she receives due to her fathers death a year earlier. She and her mother have been getting along fine, just fine, on their own. Her mother constantly works, and Macy helps her by sticking to their routine and keeping a perfectly clean house. Shes content with her perfect boyfriend and perfect grades and perfect life. That is, until a hectic catering company enlists her help at one of her mothers work parties. She then realizes how exciting chaos can be and how interesting real friends are. I read this book for my Read-a-Thon at school and I finished it in the day. It contains some serious issues, but overall its an airy read. The issues aren't heart-wrenching nor are they abnormal, so the book is easy to relate to. I could complain about its predictability or sappiness, but The Truth about Forever is defintely a book about the journey. It doesnt matter that the reader knows within the first chapter that Macy will fall for the gorgeous catering guy, Wes. Or that the book will have pages about finding yourself, realizing happiness, and moving on. I knew coming into the novel this wasn't a heavy book, which is why I enjoyed it. Its entertaining, and thats why I like Dessens books. Always, she writes books that serve to entertain and relate to teens. I flipped happily through the pages, never bored, but never thrilled either. The characters are fun and normal and don't have anything special about them. Her books are so realistic. The world isn't going to end and the characters don't have anything life altering happen to them. She somehow writes about ordinary days but still engages the reader wholeheartedly. The Truth about Forever is a cute romance between two teens trying to find themselves. The plot isn't extraordinary, but the writing style and characters really make the book. Compared to the other Dessen books Ive read, this one isn't as good, but I still found myself entertained while reading it. More book reviews at Stealingpages."
Books_5,negative,truthful,"The story: Betrayed by her new husband, lovely Scottish bride Iolanthe MacLeod dies by the sword in the fall of 1382 in a landlocked keep on the English moors, far from the sea she loves. She gives up on her dreams of a man coming to rescue her and spends the next 600 years haunting the castle were she was killed. However, when Thomas McKinnon arrives to see the castle he purchased in 2001, she  recognizes him as the man from her dreams. At first all Thomas wants to do is restore his crumbling old castle, but he finds himself falling in love with a ghost. Now all he has to do is find a way for Iolanthe to become a permanent part of his world.
  This is my first book to read by Lynn Kurland, and to be fair, it would have been better if I had read her other books first. She has a whole series on the MacLeods/MacKinnons/De Piagets. However, I do think that books in a series should be able to stand on their own and this falls a little short. There are too many back stories that need to be explained, and a lot of loose ends that are not tied (presumably these will be explained in later books).
  This story does invovle time travel, and ghosts, so it requires a lot of imagination on the reader's part. The relationship between Thomas and the ghost inhabitants of the castle is quite funny and some of the supporting characters are quite likable. I loved the part where Iolanthe uses Thomas's computer to teach the garrison how to read. The part of the story where Thomas rescue's Iolanthe is also quite exciting and romantic. There are no love scenes in this book, only a few kisses and embraces. There is some violence and descritpions of battle scenes. If you like books in a series, I would recommend this book, but if not, then you may want to skip this one.

Specializing in paranormal romance and fiction"
Books_5,negative,truthful,"Despite having the entire Divergent series ruined by the utter mind-rape that was Allegiant, which was in my opinion just a 526-page plot hole of nonsense, I decided to read the Four collection -- mainly because the e-book was available for free at my library and the other books I wanted to read weren't ready yet and I had time to kill. My conclusion after reading all of the short stories is. meh. Roth seems more capable of writing a boy who doesn't sound like a teenage girl when she isn't trying to write the girl character at the same time - I'm looking at you, Allegiant - but the writing style is still not all that different. As for the stories themselves, knowing the truth behind everything as revealed in Allegiant made it hard to care about anything or take any of it seriously, so I was forced to make a very conscious effort to block that book out of my mind (moreso than I already have) in order to just accept these stories for what they were in the ""original"" Divergent universe. And the stories were just okay. While we do learn some new details about Tobias's early Dauntless life and answer some unanswered questions, not much of it is all that interesting, and the last short story, which covers a good half of the plot from Divergent, is basically just fan fiction. All in all it was just. okay. Altogether the collection was a three-star read. There was nothing particularly offensive about it, but nothing all that interesting, either. If you must read it, borrow it from a friend or get it at the library. It's really not worth taking up permanent residence on your bookshelf or Kindle library. (Oh, and if you're going to buy it in e-book format, buy them separately. Amazon seems to be taking advantage of the fact that some people may not be observant/bright enough to notice that it's actually more expensive when you buy the bundle than if you just bought them for $1. 99 each."

Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,We tried playing playing this game at every level and no one could get into it.

Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"the buttons are too hard to flip/push.  he gives up, and we've had it for over 6 months."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"Careful stretching as they tear fairly easy.  However for the price/quantity, they were good Easter egg hunt stuffers"
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,I like the idea of this but it was hard for my preschooler to get the cards into it.
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,When it arrived it was already broken and did not work I added new batteries and it did not work.
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,I don't like that the animals aren't printed on the board.  My daughter has no idea where they go.

Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,These balls are okay but not my babies favorite toy by far. She does like the yellow one that lights up.
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,My son was excited to receive this until after building it there were many missing parts what a disappointment #Leanne Flashberg
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,Looks very cheap and not cute.  Some animals need to guess who they are. Just ok for the prise .
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"These were fine.  100 pieces sounded like a lot, but in reality there weren't very many. They are tiny little chips."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"Nice way for my daughter to practice applying makeup. Make goes on paper pretty good, better than I thought. She enjoys it."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,within a week battery cover falling out. made so cheaply and siren is unbearable. no on off switch for sound at all.
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"If you have dogs or cats I can't suggest these, they are magnets to hair! Its VERY frustrating. I'm finally giving them away."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,Very flimsy - pieces come off easily making play time with it more difficult. Could have been built stronger. Disappointed for my daughter
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,Smaller than what I expected but of decent quality! Fun little thing to have around when you want to have a few laughs.
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,the product i recieved was not as pictured had the wrong battery connections  ! I can not charge this or use it!
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"Expensive, interesting because it magnified cool things, but after a week it sat unused on the floor for months. I wouldn't recommend buying this."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,The quality of the board is okay. This is the set my family had when I was a kid so I went with it.
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,songs do not continuously play you have to press the button for the next song plus the songs are not soothing for an infant
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,The price for the tablecover isn't too expensive but that definetly shows in the product. They served their purpose but they were nothing special
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"These broke fairly easily and are a bit light.  Better to purchase heavier dominoes for rallies.  Great idea, just sort of cheap"
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,Very difficult to get playdough out of the cutters even for adult fingers. Not a product my preschooler can play with alone without frustration.
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,I had to drill larger holes in order for this part to fit and it still has a bit of friction from that process..
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,Looks like pictured but my daughter doesn't  like how much the puffy sleeves are sewed in.  She complains that they bother her.
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,I only got 1 egg and the surprise was horrible. Don't waste your money. These eggs are not like the ones you see online.
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,very small print.  can hardly read the cards  not very fun.  i don't suggest you buy it.  wish it was better
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"Chincy, Chincy, Chincy - pieces were soooo small and fragile - kids couldn't even put together -
the parts were so small too - totally disappointed"
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,I paid little so didn't expect much. Fun at first but didn't take long before it broke. My daughter would loose interest in it quickly.
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"The flat clippers in this collection is my favorite tool for this purpose. The other two are okay, but I prefer equivalents I've gotten elsewhere."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,HORRIBLY STUPID GAME. IF YOU ENJOY TALKING ABOUT POOP AND FARTS THEN GO AHEAD AND BUY IT-IF NOT.... WELL DON'T BOTHER WASTING YOUR MONEY THEN!!!
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,Decent idea.. but it doesn't add enough to gameplay. Almost always end up only playing the original version. Takes longer and setup is more complex.
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"A simple game, not really a lot too it. But cute art, quick play, and not a lot of thought needed so it's a keeper."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,The bar came off the woodbase within an hour and a half of giving it to the child. And they weren't even being rough with it!!
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"Ok, but not the quality of orbeez. They fall apart easily and do not hold up. After 48 hrs in a bin they started to smell"
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"Gigantic ripoff. What arrived was a thin brown hooded cape in a plastic bag. NOTHING ELSE. No belt, no undershirt, no boot covers. Total waste of money."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"I wasn't too impressed with the quality and functionality of this book, so I returned it and have one made through a lady from etsy instead :)"
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,I thought for the price that I was getting a large full sheeted booklet of stickers. It's not an 81/2 by 11 book. It's more like 4x6.
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"way to little, I should have read the product details.  Also metal bars didn't fit into the base plate as the holes were not sized right."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,Standard size? Are you kidding? This was HUGE!!!!! It fell right off my thumb. The sides didn't even touch it. It's not standard size.
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"Bought it as a gag gift so I did not expect it to do much, but it broke immediately upon trying to pick something up with it"
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"Simple game, kids like it because it says ""dude perfect"".  They use the beanies to do trick shots and don't bother with playing the actual game."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,Dissent gloves but one or two of the fingers wouldn't glow. :-( so had to return it. But git a fast return so turned out good.
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,Not easy to grow anything in these small tubes.  The plant didn't show roots and ended up rotting out and not really growing.  Would not recommend.
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,My son is pretty hard on his toys and he liked this one so he played with it a lot but still I expected more than a week
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,The costume itself is really cool and the material is great. They run a size bigger so it didn't work out for my son but very cool costume.
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"These are good enough, however, there is not a red.  For 50 colors you would think a red would be included.  Most colors are pastel in nature."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"My sons favorite item this Christmas. Great product holds so many of his figures

. Only negative is that for a three year old it's a bit difficult to open"
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,I am not thrilled about the quality of this figure. It looks why better in picture when you get it it looks very plastic. But hey he's a keeper
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,This game was pretty frustrating for my 8 year old.  A lot of the cards were very difficult to perform.  Tried it once and that was it!
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"Unfortunately the articulation makes the figure's top half look a little freakish.  But If that doesn't bother you, you get a lot of playability and displayability with that articulation."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,I bought this for my son. He opened it yesterday and it is BROKEN today. He didn't do anything crazy.... it is just a poorly made toy. DON'T BUY THIS.
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,I received two heart penguins and no circle penguin.  Disappointing as we are also using these to study our shapes.  Otherwise as a toy themselves they are nice.
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,It is a sturdy game and was as described.  I thought my special needs grandson would enjoy the Operation Game but it provided only a few hours of entertainment.
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"Love the game, but it looked like it came to us used. The box was all damaged and there was tape everywhere. Gave as a gift and was kinda embarrassed."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"These were ok, the printed side was great but the non printed side is just all white. I could have printed these off the computer and saved a little money."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"The listing said these were 12mm hex, they're more like 14mm hex, vary disappointed seeing how this was the last thing I needed to get my slash back on the road."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"My futaba striped out after 5 months so I put this Savox servo in my rc8.2e buggy. I turned it on, turned left, turned right and pop! The tabs broke off."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"It's not bad but that is not strong so after using several times it's frustrated.
And i don't know the use of the white bar. There's also no tips.

Delivery is not bad,"
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"Lots of varying/great pieces for the price, but a lot of them are rough around the edges so we had to sand them down ourselves to keep the kids from getting splinters."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"This product probably works great for most, but with my preemie, it was too big and cumbersome.  We decided to go for the angelcare system and have been happy with that."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"We love lego and star wars. This is our least favorite lego set. It is very fragile and frustrating to put together

Disappointed in this set. And we are rarely disappointed with lego."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"I was very disappointed with this purchase for my 5 year old.  It is very small, hard to transform, and comes apart very easily.  There are better Transformers out there."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,They were ok. Big pack of mini plastic horses. You can tell they are cheap. Worked well enough for table decor for daughters birthday. All wouldn't stand. A couple could not balance.
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,I feel like it's overpriced for what you get. It is nice to get everything in one package but I was able to find plates of the same quality at the dollar store.
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"They didn't work.  Sent back for a full refund.  We could see ourselves in the screen, but no sound, and couldn't see the other person.  Super disappointing on Christmas morning."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,My granddaughter dropped this one time from about two feet up onto the hardwood floor and it never worked again. Don't waste your money. I'd give it a minus star if I could.
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,I like this thing but it's so small. How I wish they had made a larger one. I will know more this summer if the sun shining through it will make a fire.
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"poor quality expensive  item!

i bought this light saber for my son 7 years old.

Big piece of Sh......"
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"Bought this for my 8 year old daughter. The neck is not straight, it will not tune, and it is going back the same day it was delivered. Don't waste your time and money."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"I got a snake that was a plain, dull dark green color on top and unpainted on bottom. No where near as nicely painted as the one pictured. Looked like a dollar store item."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"Neither my 3yo or 1yo seemed particularly interested in these ones, although I have the other set, which I put in the bath, and they really like playing w/ the magnets in the bath."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,Quality is not so good.  Each piece has some splinters in it.  Took us forever to get the set to the smoothness that we can allow our child to play with it.
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"I give it 3 stars because the Barbie and the two animals are great, I'd give them 5 stars, but you're buying this as a package and the other stuff is not very good."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,I got this for my son for Christmas a while back when it first came out... He barely played with it and lost most of the pieces. It's fairly annoying to set up and use.
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,This thing is tiny lol I was expecting a much taller tree. I guess I should have paid more attention to the size chart. It fell over every chance it had and deflated easily. Junk.
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"Tin was awesome and looked Awesome, the cards were almost all trash for my deck. The price is worth it, but a warning that you might not get what you're after besides the cover card."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,I would love to love this because it was fun for a little while but a little while was less than half an hour.  My 3 year old granddaughter managed to break it that quickly.
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,Good concept but the suction cups aren't strong enough to hold this up it keeps falling down on my child especially when they go to get the ice cream bubbles out with the lever.
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,Not at all what I was expecting. This was a large box of plastic pieces that don't fit together. I'm sure the only way this toy would be usable is if you glued the pieces together.
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,The pewter AVENGERS logo is pretty enough but I was disappointed to discover it was a safety pin style back pin instead of a 2 pc stick pin and backing. The latch pin style rarely lasts long.
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"A little tricky to fill with air without letting a bunch out while trying to get the plug in. But fun!
Also, I don't know why it came out of box with a sticky/greasy residue all over it."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"My kids love dinosaurs. We had something similar that we purchased from a museum, but some of them went missing. So, we got these as a replacement. More than half of them were deformed and had no faces."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"The picture quality is nice, but the pieces come apart easily if my child bumps into them, and some of them are not exactly flat, so I have to push them down onto our flat hard wood floor."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,The ink is awful!! Plan to buy refill ink immediately. The stamp shows up so light on the paper it's really hard to even see it. The stamps themselves are adorable and the only reason we didn't return it!
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"Fluxx is not a stand alone game. I missed that part when I ordered it, although I should've caught the fact that it's an expansion game. I'll update when I get more to add to the game. Sounds fun."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"Don't be fooled by the appearance of this puzzle. The short diagonals DO NOT ROTATE at all, and the long diagonals don't rotate on the axes you'd expect. It's just a 3x3 Rubik's cube pretending to be something new."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,very disappointing Christmas gift for our granddaughter. She opened it expecting the table to have lights and sounds but got nothing. We thought it might just need new batteries but that did not work. Very upset with this item!
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,Disappointed as was my grandson. Described as a real tablet however there is no browser and therefore he is unable to access anything other than the provided apps. Unable to access other educational sites. Basically just an expensive toy.
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"These are cute, but they don't work at all. My daughter (5) picked these out, I think she wanted to use them at the zoo, but really it's just a pretend set of binoculars. They are really durable though."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"From the photo I expected this to be taller. It says 11"" high but I measured it and its not that tall. The color is good and quality seems good, but for this small size it is way overpriced."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"Recipient loved it, a lot. However, what's not so lovable, is the mess. It's also too expensive, in my opinion. As long as you don't mind the price or the inevitable mess of water and glitter everywhere, go for it."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,My preschool students had a hard time with the wands.  They didn't really hold the bubble solution.  It was nice to get so many for a reasonable price.  Used when teaching about things blowing in the wind.
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"Bought 2 of these for my Blade Nano Fpv quad to see if they were as great as advertised.  One powered it for 3:30, the other wouldn't make it to 3:00.  I've had cheaper batteries that performed better."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"Unbelievable! This was such a rare car, and I thought it would be cool. But no, soon after I bought it, the tow cable came off, and the paint on the windshield got scratched off. Not recommending this to anybody!!"
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"Too small for anything useful.  I wanted to use one to cover the camera on my computers but they're too small! I'm sorry I bought them, but since they were so cheap,  I won't bother to return them."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,Elmo is adorable and my baby loves it but it sheds like crazy. There is little red fur everywhere. All you have to do is touch it and it loses fur. This thing is gonna be bald in a month
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"This toy would benefit greatly from an on/off switch.  My 9 mo old seems mildly entertained by it, but you can't turn it off, you can't put it away. I think I'm going to have to get rid of it."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"Super cute dolls however the arms/hands come off rather easy.  They are supposed to, as in Monster High School doll style, but these are way too easy to pull off.  We lost an arm within an hour of play."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"I thought it would be bigger and more mobile!! The jaw it moves very good, but I thought it would be mobile on its limbs and tail!! I thought the texture it would be more realistic!! Not worth the money I spend!!"
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,This is poorly made and poorly designed. The hose attachment was impossible to secure and the donut hole with the blue plastic curtain looked like an uncomfortable fit for my 2 and 4 yr old grand kids. It was returned as defective.
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"The worst finger paint! It's incredibly thick and fairly hard to use. But worse, it's so difficult to wash off and (at least temporarily) stained my daughter's hands! I think highly of M+D in general but they should be embarrassed by this."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,The snake is long and pops out great but the can is impossible to open. I couldn't do it. My husband had to work at it. Going to try a regular chip can like one review said and I'll see how it works
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,My two year old liked that she could wipe mud off but it returns in second which frustrated her. Also I think they fill with water and can get mood inside (haven't looked yet). She played with them first day but hasn't since.
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,I have to use it as a PC link instead of a field programmer. My Castle Link quick connect does not allow this to function independently of a computer. I imagine it would work perfectly if I wired it directly to the ESC though.
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"The material around the slap bracelets is fairly thin, and I do not believe I received any of the black poka dots in my package. I also only received one of the random zebra print bracelets, which of course is the one everyone wants."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"I purchased the cake pop kit as a Christmas present, but when my daughter opened the cake pop box Christmas morning, the donut maker was inside. The donuts were fun to make & tasted yummy...just wish we would have been sent the correct item!"
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,Bought this last Christmas for my kids. My kids had a blast playing with it but it only lasted a few months.  Too bad.  It just stopped working.  When I went in to change the batteries they were eroded.  scary.
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"the board that hold the balls didn't have numbers that were easy to see, they were black and not well printed on there, i bought this same set from walmart with no problem with the board so it might of just been this one"
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"Although this is a great toy for an older child, I wasn't aware it had to be built. I didn't read it or they didn't describe as such)  I sent it back as my grandson is four and not into ""building"" things just yet."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"The one I ordered didn't work even when I changed out the batteries. Apparently reading the feedback I am not the only one this has happened to. Nothing against the seller but this product looks unreliable. It's cute, but it doesn't work half the time..."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"I got this from Toys R Us, not from amazon.
It's ok...doesn't have a good ""rock"" to it. My only complaint is my daughter's (20 months) foot gets stuck in the gap under the horses belly/legs when it's on the ""rocking"" setting. I'll post a photo later."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"loved the scissors style tool, the tweezers and the bulb syringe.  The yellow tool (pictured on the left hand side) was pretty cool, BUT it broke the first day of use.  The quality of that tool was not as good as the other three."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"We got this game as a gift, but this version of it had tiny plastic stones instead of the larger glass ones. Our kids are 4 and 5 and the larger stones would have been preferable, plus it is advertised as glass. We won't keep this one."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"These are made for small ears only! Like a child's ears. Unless you have small ears as an adult, you'll have difficulty securely placing these on. Avoid purchasing them, unless you discover some way to make them fit your ears better... that doesn't result in damaging them."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"Great starter set for my son. Easy to use tools and great color assortment for a starter set. My only complaint is the set of 3 plastic molds has 2 of the same casts. So instead of having 24 different shapes to mold, we actually have 16...."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"My son loves paint with water.  These are really cute and have plenty of adorable pictures.  The paint requires a lot of water to actually work, and then the paper just gets way too wet, but they are fine to keep him occupied for a bit."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,I liked the idea of this toy but once I received it I left it in the packaging and re-gifted it to someone else.  It seemed way to complicated for a baby and overall isn't something I would have bought had I seen it in the store.
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"Hard to use, and the crayons are really skinny and fall out/break easily. I recommend the egg shaped crayons by crayola that are all crayon with no plastic part if your child is under 2 or the super jumbo sized regular style crayons if your child is over 2."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"Was so very disappointed by this purchase! These rocks are TINY!!!!! Seriously like half the size of a dime!
Got them for my 4 yr old as a Christmas gift- ended up being a stocking stuffer bc so small and they were lost almost immediately- I repeat tiny TINY rocks!!!!!"
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"These are thin and flimsy but we only used the as party hats for a few hours. So for the price, they did what we expected. Just don't expect to get a lot of use or long term use out of them. They fit 2-8 year olds just fine."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"Get this for the wand alone.  The crown is a complete disappointment overall.  Its far too small and you can definitely tell its just a cheap plastic crown.  If you can find the crown in metal that is also sold on Amazon, go with that instead."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"Darn, I must not have read the fine print somewhere.  I bought these for a friend to light up her backyard for parties, etc. but they say ""Not for Outdoor Use"".  Disappointing.  They're also a bit hokey looking.  I guess you get what you pay for."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"Pony was definitely cheap, but the box/play mat is okay. It is small so be aware of that before ordering! It is the perfect size for my 2 year old daughter though and even my boys 6 and two 4 year olds run off with their sisters toy to play...."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"Got for my 5 year old son and Georgie couldn't hear or respond to him. My husband and I had to do it, and it couldn't always underdtand us which was frustrating. The quality of it is good, and it's very cute, just ended up not working out for us."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"I don't ususally give legos anything less that 5 stars, however, this one looks cool, but it is constantly falling apart. My son can't even hold it without peices falling off. It's very unbalanced, the quality of the design could have been better thought out. But overall, my kids like it."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"Loot is fun with a crowd and quite easy to teach.  Some people always win and some people always lose.  It is the rash , impatient people who lose; wanting to get the game going.  Some players have trouble seeing the dark, deep colours of the card pirates."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,This is another product where the marketing tells a story that is better than the product itself.  This product isn't the highest quality and our kids really don't use it.  Don't get me wrong.  It's ok for some water play outside but the hand pump is pretty flimsy.
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,Very fun but not durable at all.  Falls apart and breaks easily.  We don't play with it long because there isn't much to it but the people are fun to play on our other play sets and the kids enjoy using the launcher.  Definitely not worth full price.
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"This was a birthday gift for a 6yo who loves Sonic. When we received them, they were in a plastic bag and looked really cheap...they are small plastic figurines. As much as i thought they were ridiculous, the kid loved them...so I guess if your kid loves sonic, they are great!"
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,Lid pops off if dropped. Not spill proof will leak wherever it lays. And worst part is while washing for first use the rim sliced 3 of my knuckles deep enough to bleed profusely. I can only imagine what it might do to my child's mouth if she don't have the lid.
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,This is a great puzzle holder for the thinner M&D puzzles but does not work as well for the chunky puzzles.  You can still get them in but they take up two slots due to their height.  I wish M&D would make a universal puzzle rack for ALL their puzzles.
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"Batterys work great.  Gives a lot more flying time and great price.  The charger is slow and the biggest complaint would be that the lights indicating if a battery is being charged, flicker on and off if you bump the charger.  It does charge them, but could be better."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,I think it should be mentioned that I received a package of these in a ziploc sandwich bag.  They are not bright and shiny like the picture but dull.  I'm not sure why these are being sold this way but I had to return the one ziploc bag I did receive
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"it must just be kids. My son loved it for two days...its funny how kids give you a really good guilt trip to get them something then after you get them the thing they want the most, then find out in less than the time it takes to deliver it, they lose interested."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"This toy totally squeaks when it is pulled. Gave it as a gift to friends and was embarrassed when their little one started wheeling it around and I could see the parents cringing. What's worse is I gave them the Plan Toy Push Along Duck at the same time, and that also squeaked! Ugh."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"Very bad sculpt. But then again. ML has not done good woman faces except for probably Hope Summers and Moon Stone. I also have the new Legends Infinite Black Cat. Although the black cat is missing biceps swivel. it is still a better quality fig then this.
This White Queen is expensive and not worth the price."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"We tried 4 batteries and it barely moved.  We tried another 4  new batteries and it ""moved"" a little.  We attempted to make our first creation and the wheel died again.  Also, any downward pressure stops the wheel.  I was left with a hunk of clay and one very disappointed girl."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,I do not say this lightly. This set is absolute garbage. I realize these items are supposed to break but the legs will not even stay attached to the table and one the chairs fell apart as well. My daughter opened this last night and most of it is ready to be thrown out this morning.
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"What a disappointment. This toy was sold at at a national toy store... you know... the one with the giraffe. It was $11.99 there.

I hop online to amazon assuming I'll get a good deal. Nope. Uh... Talk about a bad price. Hopping on down to the local lego store when I'm in the area. It's $12.99 there."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"My daughter has a Pig pillow pal that she loves sleeping on but it's getting pretty old and worn out. This unicorn can't be laid on comfortably because of the large tail. She loves how it looks but won't use it. It's also too big to play with so for me, this was a waste of money."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"I have to admit when I first saw this, I wasn't about to purchase it, but I caved in and purchased it anyway, I wasn't impressed with this, and wished I had kept my money. After you hear this, and I must say, the music isn't even from this famous show, and that was the let down."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"These are cute, but very small. The pictures make them seem large and even though I checked the measurements, they still seemed small. Some of the drawstrings are not stitched correctly so they are fraying. Plus my order was missing a few bags. But they worked as party favor holders, which is what I wanted them for."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,I bought these for my two girls. These earrings were more like flat stickers not the puffy kind you sometimes see. I cut them for the Christmas advent calendar instead of candy this year. They didn't even stay on ears for 5 minutes before falling off. Girls were disappointed and so was I after I paid for these.
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"My 2 year old loves these dolls so I got her this one. The headband is horrid. I figured it would come off, but it is sewn to her head and the bow is totally lopsided. I would have returned it immediately, but once she saw it, she wouldn't let me so now we are stuck with it."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"I was very excited about this for my nephew who LOVES these animals. When I got it in the mail, the paint on the face was much different than the picture and very faint. It did not look near as cute as it did online. He was still excited to have a new animal for his ""habitats"" though!"
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,I got this for my daughter's for $35. It wasn't worth that much and certainly isn't worth the current price. It falls apart constantly which makes it easy to lose parts. Also it is made with very cheap plastic. I gave it two stars because my girls did enjoy playing with it. I was just disappointed in the quality.
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,Only tried one egg so far. Very disappointed! The shell started cracking within a few hours. After the first day the tiger came out but could never tell what it was. Tried to let it keep sitting but just became a slimey mess. My 3yo niece lost interest because it was nothing interesting to look at other than an orange glob.
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"My son never really played with this much, he had a hard time changing it and when you get it in the truck shape the legs wouldn't really lock into place so it was kind of awkward for him to play with.  While he was in robot form the axe wouldn't stay in his hand. We were disappointed with this one."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"The head is VERY wobbly. It feels like it could fall off at any moment. The strap broke within a day of play. It's cute, but it's not very durable, and the battery compartment keeps coming out of the velcro. I read reviews about the sound not working, but ours is fine. It plays a galloping sound, but no music or anything."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"I did not find the answer cards as funny as a lot of the original black box cards are.  The question cards were not all that great either.  It was fine to pick through to grab a few out and put in the main deck, but I would not buy any future packs unless they are on a good discount."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,Pretty dice but not what I expected based on the picture provided by Amazon. I should have read the reviews but I pulled the trigger based on the image alone. They are nice and sparkly. Reminds me of the unicorn fad but just not what I was looking for. Chessex please update your dice listings with descriptions of the colors and more images!
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"Cheaply made, very light and chinsy from the one I remember growing up. They have minimized the amount of plastic used on the records and the on/off button is shown but not able to be used. It requires batteries opposed to being strictly a wind-up toy. Disappointed with the direction fisher price is heading. Seems like it is all about money, not quality."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"My daughter likes it.  But the first time she used it, one of the colors broke off.  Then the inside got wet and softened the other colors.  She can still use it, but as soon as the warm water hit it, its like a clay texture.  She gets it under her finger nails and it makes more work for me."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"Wish I would have read the reviews before I purchased this!.... My son really wanted this for his birthday present. It doesn't come in any of the packaging!!! Just in a clear plastic bag, no batteries or anything! I don't feel comfortable giving this as a gift, seems odd to me! I absolutely despise when things are misleading! Such as this.... I didn't get what's pictured!"
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,Poppit what?! Cheap and doesn't work. The clay does not pop out of cheap plastic bottle like picture shows. There isn't even all the tools that it shows on package. My daughter used the clay and decorations and could have just bought her molding clay. There should be a law against selling toys that don't do what they say on package. Would give 0 stars if possible!!
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"Cool factor = off the charts... Operations for 6 year old = little tricky... Irritating 6 year olds parents = whoops my bad!
Kids love it, the volume level on this thing is comparable to a boom box turned to about a 8 setting and sitting right next to you.  Parents yanked batteries in less than 48 hours  So overall guess I should've bought something else."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"I bought three of these previously (black, green & blue), and they were all 10"" long x 6"" tall, as described. Not this one. This one is 1. 25"" shorter in length (from back of handle to end of barrel) and almost an inch shorter in height! So is the pink one above it in the picture. The black one on top is only 8"" long and 4."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"My kid loves this toy, but the doors fall off really easily.  However, the doors are easy to put back on, but the doors seems to always fall off.  Despite the door issue, the music that comes with the van is highly entertaining for children and my daughter loves to play with it.  I recommend it, but be prepared to constantly put doors back on."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"Honestly, we only played it once, but after loving Ticket to Ride (the original), we found this one not nearly as much fun.  Almost all the routes are the same value, and you can't take multiple long route cards, the segment lengths between stations are mostly the same, and so about the only thing that seems to determine who wins is who gets the tunnel across Russia."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,Fun blaster I wish I could get more mags if you were 8 I have no clue how you use this the charging handle is  like a mile long. It may jam but you have to work with it to get it unstuck. you have to rack it allllll the way back with both handles and allll the way forward to never have a jam. you rack slowly.
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"They were sent in a display box, perfect for storage and classrooms.  Each stamp was sealed in plastic so no worries about it falling a part in goody bags or pinatas. Cheaply made but got the job done. Great for younger kids. When stamped my ink pads were falling out so I would watch the little ones with them. Other than that they are great for what I wanted!"
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"Bought this for Christmas. My son opened it but did not play with it until a few months later. It does not work after my son followed the first instruction. He's really good at building, but I inspect his work and confirm he did everything right. Checked all batteries also. We have experience with other snap circuit kits and never had problem before. We didn't make a mistake, it just doesn't work."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"I returned the game because it was poorly made.  The holes that were supposed to be in the center of the discs were off-center, so they didn't stack properly.  Some of the holes weren't cut big enough, so they didn't even fit on the pegs.  The pegs don't fit well into the holes that were cut for them, so they fall out easily while the game is being played."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"It doesn't work after two times of playing and each time was like  less than ten minutes! First, it is true that it's super annoying. Constantly making noises that my kids played with it a bit and put it to sleep. After the second time put it to sleep ( with the yee mask on), it just won't wake up anymore. Changed two sets of new batteries but still not working. Returned."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"The toys inside you have to assemble. But they are micro toys and can be tuff to put together. Assembly instructions are easy, but the parts are small and tuff on the fingers to snap into place. My fingers started to hurt just after the first toy. Not recommend for young kids, parts are way to small and easy to swallow. After the toy is assembled, they are easy to pose and play with."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,Pretty good but quickly gets loose. I am still a beginner but compared to my DV888 the ?wings? of the yo yo start to unscrew very quickly suring regular play. When you go to tighten them again the string tends to get stuck in between the bearing and the wall which the requires you to take it apart... another small quibble is that the string it came with did not last very long at all
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"Bought this game for Christmas.  While it's amuzing it's not overwhelmingly challenging or outrageous.  I agree with others that after you've played it for a while it becomes mundane.  We had fun, but the game lasted too long for our crowd.  Playing with more than 4 players takes too much time. We like speed games and this one is just too slow for us.  Don't know if I'd buy it again."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"Cutting food is such a great concept and kids love to chop this stuff. My daughter has a fruit cutting set by Plan toys and those are by far better quality than this Melissa and Doug fruit/veggie set. The Plan brand has better quality wood and the paint is not sloppy and chipped as it is on this toy. On the other hand, my daughter plays equally with both sets. You get what you pay for."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"Very lacking to say the least. This was one of our special fav books by Dr Seuss for sure..

This game does need to work together, flexibility, and ability for shapes colors and etc.. Its kinda unique compared to other games for sure but i also agree it falls short and doesnt fit the ages that it says it should! It was kinda flimsy made too... things just you kinda want umph a little bit more better etc."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"I bought Tow Mater without knowing you needed a lot of space to run to get him to start  blowing bubbles. After a while of my son getting frustrated I decided to wash him and he is now an indoor toy. Every time Mama vacuums, my son runs and gets Mater and pretends to vacuum using him. It wasn't a total loss because he is happy and has played with him a lot, just not for bubbles."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"My 19 month old son loves to vacuum.  So I decided to purchase a vacuum just his size.  The only problem we've had with it, is the red bottom is stuck and I can't get it to shut off!!!  I had to take the batteries out of it.  He still plays with it, but not as much.  It is a lot smaller then I thought.  I think it could have come with Batteries!!!"
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"As the view of this piano makes it seem as if it is for ""kids"" which led me to believe durable or even just a bit more than a traditional keyboard. I was dissappointed when my toddlers dropped on the carpet once and it will now not repeating a tone over and over constantly. They cannot play with it at all, and the seller would not make the return because I did not think to keep the original packaging."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"This was one of the last gifts opened because it looked like a lot of work! We got it for 3 year olds and probably should have waited a year! Not all Hotwheels fit in the Turbo shooter thing, and the track does not hold together too well when cars come out of it and are sent into the u turn.
Th etracks were easy to put together, and I think this was a good starter package , especially for the price."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"I received them a couple of days ago and to be honest I am not very impressed. It looks great quality and impressive color, but very hard to put them together. Also the holes are small that they don't stick very well and easy for the toddler to break them apart with a push
I was very excited when I received them, but I hoped it did a better job
I received this product at a discounted rate for my honest and unbiased feedback"
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"I gave it an overal rating of 3 stats because it doesn't do much on its own. And it has the oddest comments:""I'm driving to the crime scene!"" Call me crazy,but I just don't want my baby learning to say crime scen too early in life. Also, this toy is meant to be part of a bigger set. So, like I said, it doesn't do that much on its own, but as part of a completed set, it may make more sence."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"Bought 2 of these for our boys to wear on the Disney Cruise for Pirate night. I wouldnt' buy again. The top is very, very sheer & see through. My son felt uncomfortable with that and wanted to wear a shirt under it, which it didn't look good or fit properly. It is poor quality top & we actually threw it away after he wore it because it ripped. The pants are ok, and the belt is ok. You get what you pay for."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"The product is not optimized for the assembly time but for the price. It takes about an hour to assembly all the parts. I also worry that it will not last too long. The screws are too small (also a risk for the baby). It could be done much better. Yes, it would cost probably $10-20 more but it could be assembled in a few minutes and be much more sturdy. For the company: Fire the experts for costs optimization and hire some good engineers."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"I'm not too sure how impressed I am with this game.  This will be another gift for Christmas and upon receiving most of the pieces are 1/8-1/4 inch thick cardboard.  I realize it's a game, but the pictures make it look a little better than cardboard.  Needless to say, I bought another Doc item to wrap with this one so when our grandbaby opens it there's not a lack of excitement.  I'll keep you posted if she likes it or not."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"When I have received this toy, the book was missed. However, Amazon solved the problem. This toy was fun for my 4 years old boy, but I have noticed the quality is quite bad. It is hard to match pins and holes on the skeleton parts. It is also a big challenge to put the organs back as they are supposed to be in a real human body. Overall, there is good idea behind this toy and general impression is not very bad, but the quality is poor."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"We bought this for our 1.5 yr old daughter, who's about 28 inches, for Christmas and had to return it. We were looking forward to it for many reasons. However, after assembling it, she went to sit in the chair and she was gigantic for it. We had to send it back. I'm sure it's a great toy, but if your child is on the taller side of a young toddler, don't waste your time or money as the age recommendation should be lower due to the height limitations."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"These are tiny.  The product description says ""11/2 inc"", which didn't make much sense to me.  I now realize that it's supposed to say 1 1/2 inches.  They are more like one inch, small enough to pose a choking hazard.  They are too small to be much fun.  The papers they come with are just regular tissue and quickly destroyed.  The box is cardboard packaging, not something to keep them in. My daughters, very into pretend play, don't play with these at all."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"I really like the colored graphics of this puzzle. The black and white side is the embodiment of frustration as my 2.5 year old can't do it. She can work on and enjoy the color side just fine but not the black and white.

The cardboard is nice and thicker then some floor puzzles I've seen/had. The pieces are smaller then I'd like in a floor puzzle (about 2x4 inches). If they were just a little bigger by an inch or two they could be better suited to putting together are carpet."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"NOTE: The one star is for the company selling the item, not the product.  I won't know this product at this price.

I know it happens every year, and we all have the option to just not purchase the item.  But, just this morning this item was available for $30 here and at Target, but I needed to get to work.  Lesson learned on that.  Now apparently those items are all sold out, so here it is at over twice the ""worth"" of the item.  It's too bad."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"My 9 yr. old requested this for Christmas.  While it was fun for a little while (even stumping it got boring), it's luster wore off quickly and it has been pushed aside already.  The questions are the same over and over again - which is only logical (it uses deductive reasoning), it's voice gets annoying and it sometimes doesn't understand your response (how many times do you need to repeat the word ""no""?).
This is a toy that MIGHT get pulled out of the shadows only when true boredom sets in."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"Cute idea and set up but the manufacturers packaging really stinks which just ruined it for me! Drum sticks and stand were tossed in loose around the actual drums that were wedged into cheap, flimsy plastic packaging. Drum sticks arrived extremely bent, to the point where it's awkward to actually hit them on the drums, which is a bummer because we bought this as a cheap starter set for our daughters birthday and now we have to hunt for new sticks so she can even play it before we can give it to her."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,The flashlight did not work right out of the box. I returned it and Amazon sent another one which also did not work! The flashlight is also quite large and too big for a toddler to use easily. The switch to turn the light on is a stiff slide switch and my 2 year old could not turn it on herself. I gave up on this flashlight and bought the Melissa and Doug bumblebee flashlight. It works fine and has an easy to push button to turn it on. I expected better from Melissa and Doug.
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"When I read through the reviews before I bought this doll I did not see one review complaining about the hair. Now I see numerous. Maybe something changed? I bought her to use in my studio for example shots but her hair is so bad it just won't work. It is several different lengths and glued on crazy like. I cannot even move it out of her face really. I gave her two stars because she is pretty doll, well made, with lots of accessories. The hair is just a no-go for me. It is going back."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"If you remember asking mom to help you with Barbie clothes as a kid, this is the equivalent only worse. Call in the national guard to help attach this doll's arms and legs... definitely not for a four year old, a six year old, or a 37 year old engineer. If this wasn't a gift, I'd return it for my very frustrated four year old. The box is supposed to serve as a little suitcase, but even that part is poorly designed. If you hold the handle, the velcro part still comes undone and doll parts go flying."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"Broke in less than 24 hours.  Probably more like 8 hours.  Come to think of it, it was about 8 trigger-pulls.  The battery connections went bad, and the pump developed a horrible leak.

This wins the award for cheapest piece of junk ever made.  Luckily I like fixing things, so I cut the handle off and installed my own battery box and replaced the pump tube with a much higher quality hose.  As pieces of it break, I will fabricate parts until it becomes a sentient cyborg bubble beast and takes over the planet."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"I actually love this doll. I purchased this for my 7 year old daughter when I was having my son. We are a biracial family, so that the baby was a boy and a light brown/medium tan, just like her (and her brother).

I'm upset because at the same time that I purchased this doll for $25, Amazon also had the white version of this doll for $19. I have a hard time understanding the huge difference. A few cents or even a dollar or two wouldn't be as insulting as paying a 30% mark up for the same doll."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,I wrote a review b4 but Amazon didn't accept it(I was horribly angry). So it wasn't published. I bought this costume for my 4yro daughter who was In love with it. Me I hated it. It's very shiny like foil. It tore in one day and kept tearing. It was a little big but that's how I wanted so it'll last. I threw it in the trash about 4 months after purchasing it. It really isn't sturdy or tasteful.  Hope you like my review now Amazon. Wish I took a pic of it before I threw it away.
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"My boys are huge Lego builders, but I thought they would enjoy this especially with the motor. My 12.5 year-old said that the directions were very complex yet not detailed enough. As a result, he didn't finish building it. He has built crazy complex Lego sets -- but the instructions there allow even someone like me to have a successful build. My son said the difference is that you had to figure out the orientation of the illustration and then which pieces went where. I'm hoping they will complete the project, but I'm not overly optimistic at this time."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"I received this item today and I'm not happy with the performance of the remote at all. The remote controller is faulty, it wouldn't stay on unless i applied hard pressure on the back where the batteries are located. It is quite a task pushing the battery compartment in and operating the chopper at the same time. I have screwed the battery compartment in tightly, still it wouldnt come on unless i gave it that extra push. I know my son (whom I purchased it for) wouldn't be happy with this product. Please send me a replacement controller if possible."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"I love the rocking Cow, its cute and my daughter loves it.  The reason I'm giving it a 3 is because the music/Moo feature doesn't work. If you read the other reviews, this isn't unique to my purchase.  Many of them don't work, and yes, it is one that is supposed to actually make sound because his ear says ""Press Here"" and nothing happens. Tried different batteries and everything.. just doesnt work.  3 because it is faulty. My daughter loves to say ""Mooooo"" as one of the first animal sounds she is learning, so I was disappointed."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"I've become a collector, that's why I bought this. Do not buy this as a speed cube or first cube for someone because you think it ""looks cool"". It does. You see the inner workings. BUT...what's cool about this cube also happens to make it a nightmare to solve. In direct light, colors are difficult to spot. Very difficult. And as for mechanics, it's terrible compared to so many other brands. This is niche market--if you're like me, and became obsessed with cubes, and want to own one that's truly aesthetically pleasing, yeah, but it. But that's the only reason to."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"Sad that this doesn't come with any of the critters. It is basically an add-on for those who already own some of the Calico Critter sets. For $20.00 I would have expected at least one. Well, we shall put it up until we get some of the Calica Critters to go with it. For now, all I can say us that is looks nice and well crafted and you can turn the handle and make it spin. Shrugging this one off for now. Docking 2 stars for not including that it doesn't come with a Critter anywhere in the product description."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"To be honest, I thought this was a different trick I've seen elsewhere, but the general concept is the same.  The one problem is this is not a trick you can do close up or in high illumination.  The gimmick is very visible and identifiable.  Also, if you have big hands like I do, let's just say this trick is not for you.  It's made for people with small hands.  So I would have to say I was disappointed with the product.  It would be nice if these drawbacks were clearly stated in the product description."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"This particular Ellie I ordered only gets three stars. This one has ears and legs that are not symmetrical. It doesn't look quite like the one in the picture. I have another one that belongs to my daughter that is symmetrical and looks like the picture on Amazon. It's a year older, but not sure why this new one looks a little weird. I'd consider looking for one in a store, or you could just take a chance on the one from Amazon. It's not awful, just not quite right. (Although it had the Ty Beanie Boo tag on it and everything."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"My 2yr old received this on her 1st b-day and she loved it. This was her first experience with using crayons in the tub, and it was a treat while it lasted. My biggest complaint is that the crayons ""shorten"" rather quickly so...as they shorten, the harder it is for little and big fingers to get out. It used to frustrate her so I stopped letting her use them. Now she uses the Dorothy fish bowl as a fun water strainer. Elmo is great too, he dries quickly, overnite and he is good to use as a learning tool for the young bather."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"It seems what other people said in the negative reviews are true about this rc truck. The steering is to far off it can not be adjusted staight,it basically drives in circles. The instructions say the charger light will stop blinking when battery is fully charged, I guess the battery is never fully charged. Last of all, the piece that the truck body clips on to is unscrewed from the frame, the screw is there, its just not screwed together. I feel for the price this rc truck should come in working order, not very happy with this purchase and will be sending back."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"Madewell even though it is of plastic unlike the old traditional still dump trucks. I noticed that the dump area it's self is actually a lot smaller than it used to be. I'm a 5 foot two woman roughly about 110 pounds. When my kids played with this, my butt was able to fit the dump area believe it or not. However this is so tiny that my three-year-old nephew's but barely makes it into the  dump area. Kids now play with it just as they did then. Once sits in the dump truck and the other person pushes them around all over the house."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"This is actually a nice looking dragon, but rather angry & violent looking to me.  I bought it for a young nephew based upon other reviews from folks who bought it for younger boys. I should have looked a bit more closely at the pictures,  the dragon is for  a 5 year old male is too scary.  I would recommend the forest dragon for younger kids.  This guy is a bit too much for a little kid.  I gave it to an older child who really loved it, but for younger souls the Schleich forest dragon is a bit more appropriate."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"This medical kit is just okay. Naturally, my daughters favorite part is the stethoscope. Unfortunately Fisher Price decided to make the war pieces so large that they won't even kind of fit into an adult ear, much less a 3 year olds. Also, the stethoscope is very rigid and tough to play with. The bag that comes with it is somewhat of a joke. It's very difficult to fit everything inside (especially that rigid stethoscope), and it really doesn't stay closed so everything just falls out. She does enjoy the shot thing and the thermometer though. Overall I'd go with a different toy medical kit if I could."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"My son is finally old enough to play board games and really enjoys playing them - this mama's dream come true.  I am so looking forward to sharing all of my favorites with him.  Beware though that this is not your Sorry.  This game was fun if you are not expecting to plat the game you loved as a child.  The fire and ice ""coins"" are confusing.  You have to read the directions a few times and then play it how you find easiest (they are confusing).  I will have to find an original version of this game, but it's okay as an alternative."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"So the balloons do fill up quickly as advertised, However, you have to use them right away or the water leaks out of them. We found that out the hard way when we filled up the balloons for a balloon fight that was to take place later in the day... we went to get our balloons and they were all felt. The balloons we used right away did not break easily when they were thrown - and they kind of hurt but that we were able to deal with in exchange for the easy fill up! They have their pros and cons. I enjoyed not filling up each balloon individually!"
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"I'm disappointed with this 3pack of batgirl cycle,Batcycle , &Batmobile I feel I over payed too much for little vehicles the Batcycle I already have it and I only paid $10 for it the , so how can this 3pack come out to $117 is unbelievable just because it has a backdrop of a batcave its not even THE batcave of the tv series the batgirl cycle it's only worth about $15 if they sold it separately .the problem I have with this 3pack it didn't even say the scale so I fell for it ,but now I know better to be more careful how I pick my items "
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"This is cute and the idea is great but it honestly sucks.  You can add armor on baymax, which is cool as long as you're not going to play with him or move him, because if you do, the armor will come off.  it's not meant to be played with.  The fist wouldn't stay on and the arm guards would pop off if you moved his arms, which you couldn't really move that much anyway because the clearance just wasn't there.  If you're getting this to just add to a collection, go for it but if it's for a kid to play with, get something else"
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"I'm only giving 2 stars because of how annoying this toy gets. It's so loud and there is no on off or lower volume setting. As soon as the battery is in if the trigger is pulled it goes off extremely loudly. It's a good product maybe for a child old enough to play outside on there own but for my toddler the fact I could not turn it off or adjust the volume made this toy a hell on earth for me. However it does work well and lights up and blasts loudly for the price so if you don't mind the fact it's never ending, then go for it!!!!"
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"The images themself are fun, but the printing is poor. It appears they were printed in layers of blues, reds and yellows to make each ocean animal image, but the printing didn't overlap perfectly to make a crisp picture. You can see a bit of each primary color around the edges of each animal, thus making the finer details (like eyes and little fins) fuzzy. There were also thin black lines streaking thru the images.
Also, these 13 images are printed on two large plastic sheets (like a plastic table cloth), so you need to cut them apart with scissors. I thought I was getting a ready-to-use product, and it added unanticipated time."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"For an action figure like this, where the ""main attraction"" revolves around the use of the blaster in his hand, I feel it does not meet the build quality in comparison to the rest of the toy.

The toy itself is detailed, and is sturdy enough for a 3 year old to have many hours of fun with. The blaster? Not so much. It stopped serving it's purpose within about 2 weeks.

Overall, the toy is not a bad purchase by any means, and pretty much becomes an essential action figure once your child sees Toy Story 2 for the first time, but if you do purchase, just be aware that the blaster is flimsy."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"I usually buy Ravensburger puzzles, but I liked this vintage seed packets picture so decided to give White Mountain a try seeing as it had good reviews. Sadly, the quality wasn't very good. Lots of hanging chads, ripped backings and pieces which were still joined together. On the corner of one piece, the picture was beginning to lift up off the cardboard. Not traditional shaped puzzle pieces - various angles and sizes throughout the puzzle. The pieces are larger than usual - good for someone with impaired vision. Not that challenging - easily completed in an afternoon. Personally, wouldn't buy again, but a nice picture if you had to buy puzzles with larger pieces."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"This is a build-it-yourself series of plastic tubes and corners. There are no screws to hold it together, nothing 'clicks' into place. It will not withstand anything more vigorous than the impact of the soft foam basketball it comes with. When hung over a door, the net is only about 5 feet off the ground, so it works even with fairly low ceilings.

For our purposes, this is ok, at least for now. My school-age child just wants a basketball-like activity for indoors. But sooner or later, the kids are going to turn it into a contact sport, and i expect to be able to re-assemble the rig a few times before a piece finally breaks."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"You're little one will probably want this regardless, but note that for the price, this is more of an accessory rather than a pony play house.  There aren't any places to really play inside - it's more about playing dressup with the included pony, which includes shoes, skirt, crown.

The set assembles fairly easily and for the most part stays together.  We use it more as a decoration to store her ponies on the shelf nicely. Since it is so flat, the ponies can go in front of it.

The 'bridge' stays down without the other palace playset and is unusable - kind of silly not to have it at least be a ramp up."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"Hi - I bought this sit and spin because I remember back to when I was a young boy and the countless hours i spent on my red one. I thought for sure my kids would LOVE this!! So I researched them out, chose this, gave it to my kids at Christmas and their reaction was like oh, ok...I forced them to sit on it and use it, and they couldn't even get it to spin after multiple attempts. We tried the carpet and the wood floor. This is a very cheap product, flimsy and I strongly recommend you to save your money and not buy it, or spend more money and get a better quality one."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"Disappointed with this one.  It's a hybrid of sorts: it tries to be a song maker, a piano, and a stacker all in one.  Unfortunately for small children, it's too bulky to really stack, and the drum and tambourine are too difficult to remove.  The piano plays pre-set songs, or tracks of songs, rather than notes, so children have to listen thru before they engage again.  Would have preferred individual sounds as (at least) an option.  Because of the way the sound settings work, and the ease in which the cymbal can activate, ours essentially plays one song over and over again.  We were definitely hoping for more, although it's not without its charms at times."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"I will start this by saying that my son looked awesome in this costume and the outfit itself is really great.  He got so many compliments, mostly from dads.  I think people appreciate seeing a kid dressed up as a normal person rather than a TV character or something.

The problem with this costume was with the cap:  it was misshapen and hard to keep on his head.  I tried to contact the company to get a replacement for the cap but had no luck.  I would have had to return to Amazon.  I bought too close to Halloween and the rest of the costume was so cute, we just kept it and he still looked great."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"These batteries can be one of two ways. One can hold a charge for seven or eight minutes or thirty seconds. The added weight makes it a ""Balancing game"" If it's too far forward, the chopper won't hold a hover. It's a coin toss. I put one in my mini Chinook and it flew almost 10 minutes. In my 107g, it seemed to cause the circuit board to malfunction making the 107g fly out of control. My advice, use the same type battery that came with the chopper. Understand that these batteries will start to quit holding a charge very soon. They are like store brand batteries opposed to Energizer or Duracell. Know how to solder if you plan to replace one."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"I sent this to my nephew (10yrs) who REALLY wanted this set for Christmas. He is a Lego fanatic but his family couldn't afford this toy. Well... I got word yesterday that several of the Lego pieces were split & broken in the individual sealed bags! And since they were critical pieces that had to do with the castle structure the toy can't even be used. My nephew was heartbroken since this was his ""big"" gift. One would think for $80.00+ you'd get a little more for your buck. I would NOT recommend this toy to anyone unless the manufacturer gets their quality control shortcomings straightened out. I feel like I threw my money away and disappointed a wonderful little boy at Christmas."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"We got this for our 2 and a half year old for Christmas, who loves trains. Yes, he loves the train but the coupling is very weak and loose and does not hold together well.  Also, for the price, there are very few train parts, and a lot of superfluous plain old dup.os.  Also, this item does not come with a track, although from the looks on the box, you might think so.  Another thing is that the figures that come with it are larger than other duplo sets, so they will not fit in other duplo vehicles, and the train roof will not close if they are inside. Not so much for the price. I would buy the circus train that duplo sells much cheaper."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"We have had many of the wall tracks in our house with 3 boys. This one is the one I am least impressed with. My boys tend to just skip it. The wheel is ok, but you have to have a particular rate and consistency or the car gets stuck/falls out. Also the see-saw portion is awkward and does not always work. I took great care to line everything up very level (we have a had these before and know how important that is) and still, after all the effort it is still not great. I like the other parts of this set- I would just skip this one if I had to do it over again. A waste of time and money since the boys just skip it anyway."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"If I remember correctly, this product has many great reviews which encouraged me to buy it. I love that it's made with wood and will last a long time. My four year old is very interested in it and we have attempted to play with it several times. The felt puzzle pieces that create the roads come apart very easily. This causes many problems as one begins to construct the city unless you are very delicate. The city itself must be built on a flat surface, so no carpet. This is very challenging with my two year old around. Even if she wasn't there to knock things over, it seems like it would be difficult to play with the city once set up. It is not designed to be very sturdy."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"My 4 year old like the game except he gets very frustrated when he dies which is all the time because the tools fall from the ceiling (which makes no sense) and you lose your life.  There is no way to turn on a no-die option for this game.  ALso, unlike the other vmsile games when you do the alphabet..it really puts it on order for you when you use the easy levels.  In this game you have to go hunting around..yes there are arrows but you can go in multiple directions as that's how the roads are built and it gets VERY frustrating.  The other games like the pooh and alphabet park are much better than this gae.  Inall, I would say buy a different vsmile game."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"I ordered this item assuming it was the Real Bananagrams. I was sent a cheaper ""take-off"" of the real Bananagrams game. There was no trademark for the game on the storage bag - which the original version of the game has. I compared the true Bananagrams at a local toy store and the version I was sold here was a cheaper take-off on the real product. The storage bag was cheap, thin material with lose threads. The true version of this game has a nice quality storage bag with the trademark on the bag.

The instructions actually had words that were spelled incorrectly - funny as this game is about spelling.

Just beware you might receive a cheaper ""take-off"" version of this game when ordering from this supplier.

Disappointing and also dishonnest to sell it this way."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"I bought this float for my 13 month old.  It took her less than two minutes to figure out how to pull her toes into the seat, push down on the float and stand up, which caused her to fall head first into the water. If you cant have eyes on your baby every second (I have two older children I need to watch too) this float is not safe once your baby can stand.

This float would be great for younger children and I would have given it four stars if it hadn't been advertised for children through 2 years old.  I would say it is best for children 5 months to walking. The product description should also explain that the outer ring must be inflated. I thought it had a foam ring."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"Both of my kids love Playmobil. I purchased this firetruck for my son. He loves this toy but also it'll frustrate him.
First of all, the front-window-compartment is very difficult for the kids to take off. The only way, to place a fireman on the drivers-seat is to take off this window-compartment. Second of all, the ladder comes off every time, my kids just touch it. A grown-up has to install it back on the firetruck. I don't know, why Playmobil couldn't come up with a different solution for this, but it's very frustrating for the kids, that it won't stay installed and they can't fix it themselves. The ladder won't stay up plus falls off the truck. The rest of the firetruck seems very sturdy and has bright colors. Love the sound-effects on it. Not too loud."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"Nice quality (except they could have made the game board fold in half rather than in quarters), but it's just not that much fun. It's such a cute idea and my niece and I have played Horseopoly for months, so we thought we would try this. It's really disappointing. There isn't much creativity to it; it's as though they took Horseopoly and changed the horses to rodeo events. That alone should make it charming, cute, and fun, but it doesn't. Read about it carefully before deciding. I did, but still convinced myself it was worth the outrageous amount of money (for an -opoly game). Boy was I wrong!  Now I just have to find somewhere to try to sell it so I don't feel guilty saddling someone else with it."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"I thought this looked cute but couldn't quite tell what was in it based on the picture.  Well, there are 3 lip glosses that are the goopy kind of lip gloss, not the solid kind.  So those were confiscated immediately as well as another 3 lip gloss set (that I actually thought was eyeshadow at first but was disappointed when I opened it and found more goopy lip gloss.  The nail colors are hideous but that didn't matter to me.  LOL!  My daughter would love them no matter.  She hasn't put the polish on yet but after I see how it coats, I'll come back and update.  The bag to carry it all in is cute and the lipsticks are colored but don't actually produce much of anything but a clear coating which is great b/c I really don't want that everywhere."

We got it for Christmas and my toddler loved it at first. After only a month of moderate, gentle use it is now completely broken. It's stuck on one noise so anytime we turn it on, it makes the same sound over and over again. We haven't dropped it or done anything to it (even though I would expect a baby toy to be able to withstand drops). My toddler is sad that we won't let him play with it, but I've tried everything to make it work again and it won't. It has a lot of potential and some cool features, but if those features don't work, there's no point in having it. As far as I'm concerned it was a waste of money."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"This set comes with 146 pieces to build Stewie's Time Machine as well as a Stewie figure himself.  The instructions are pretty easy to follow, no reading required just pictures to follow along.  It always amazes me how K'NEX pieces can form different buildings and pieces, but they do it and it works.  Like I said, my kids don't watch Family Guy, but they loved this little Time Machine and the Stewie figure.  They think its cool to have built a time machine, even if it is just pretend.  I will say this set does not hold together too well to play with, we had issues with the door coming off, but maybe that was just our building issues.  Oh and it was kinda weird that the back piece is cardboard and not K'NEX plastic pieces.

I received this product to review in exchange for sharing my honest opinion."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"I was very disappointed upon opening the package and seeing this poor little fellow. He is much smaller than I thought he would be, he looks cheap, his facial features are not placed in a way that looks normal, his head was not sewn correctly so it is crooked and smashed on one side. I kept him because my child specifically asked Santa for this character in a doll or stuffed version and I couldn't find another of any kind of this character.  My child loves him with all of his imperfections so it was not a waste of my money. The material and stitching are sturdy and he has held up very well with being handled and a constant companion to my child. I would not recommend this product unless you are in a similar situation to mine or unless the price of the product is less than four or five dollars."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"I had a chance to try out this game, I love the original game of life and have the board game and iOS game. This version for juniors is a let down. The game itself has promise but e construction of the board is cheap, the spinner compared to the original version is just terrible, and the cards you use some are really good like find the butterfly on the board or finish a jingle. But others are hard to u dear stand what you are supposed to do, and the rewards/penalty could easily be written clearly but ey use images and it's a bit hard to follow.

All in all yes you can play this game, but honestly I would pass on it. If they upped the quality, and didn't take shortcuts on the cards so it was easy to understand I'd say try it, but for now I have to say it's a don't buy."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"Described as easy to assemble, I don't think so, took me over an hour. To think about disassembling and toting this product around and reassembling again, is very unlikely. Comes with a carrying bag, I laughed when I thought of taking it apart. However I did because I returned it. Here's the real honest truth, cheap ,flimsy and over priced. The smaller tower was less frustrating to assemble, in the photos it shows areas where the inside poles Velcro to the tower. No, there are ties and do not stay in place. The tower that's supposed to attach to the other part with a loop and button thing, does not stay connected or flush together. My poor daughter was so upset since she was getting stuck between the 2. The other side of the tent isn't lined, the poles which Velcro the cover to the house at the bottom pop off. I really can't say anything nice about this item."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"My daughter - 2.5 years old - loves new toys and is usually a big fan of ones that interact with her.  She was not terribly impressed with this doll and neither was I.  The biggest feature of this doll is supposed to be that it giggles and laughs when you bounce and spin her.  In reality, you have to get very forceful (borderline abusive) in order to get her to ""react.""  I was concerned by the level of force my toddler needed to use to get a reaction, and I did not in any way want to encourage that level of forceful activity with her toys, especially considering that we are adding a new baby to the family soon.

Baby Alive went to the back of the closet and there have been no requests for her return as of yet.  We will probably simply remove her batteries and reintroduce her as ""just"" a cuddly baby doll."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"Manhattan Toy makes several similar products.  I also had an opportunity to review their&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Baby-Genius-Colors-and-Shapes-Soft-Activity-Book-with-Sound-for-Infants-by-Manhattan-Toy/dp/B00WPW03IU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Baby Genius Colors and Shapes Soft Activity Book with Sound for Infants by Manhattan Toy</a>&nbsp;As these products are pretty much the same, it has the same issues

I want to like this, however, the sound box doesn't come out making it difficult to wash. There is a small seam that can be taken out and resewn, but I wouldn't want to do that each time I need to clean it. The sound quality is pretty good for this toy, but IMO, the music/singing isn't all that easy to understand. My one year old didn't play with it for more than a minute. However, every child is different so your child may get more use out of it.  We have other fabric books that don't have a sound box that rely more sensory objects like mirrors and textures that keep him engaged longer than this book did."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"My 1 yr old son received this as a gift. Wish I wouldn't have tossed the box so we could return it! It collapses to easily (just while playing), the gears do not stay on- as soon as you turn either on the end they ALL pop off, and the nails pretty much fall right into the holes. If you are looking for a toy for your little boy (or girl ) to tinker around with I highly suggest the LeapFrog Fix and Learn Speedy. The drivers are a wrench and screw driver that are very toddler friendly to grasp and 'work' with, cutesy (not annoying) songs, it cues when something on Speedy breaks and needs some fixing and of course doubles as a race car. Speedy gets played with daily by my son (which says a lot for a toy). If you have a toddler that is more interested in tinkering rather than necessarily playing (like my little guy), check out Speedy, NOT this workbench!"
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"I guess the biggest criticism I have of this toy, is really my own fault for not reading the description more thoroughly. I assumed this toy would be perfect for my daughter's bathtime, or to play with in the pool.

That's not the case. Everything sinks right to the bottom it you place it in water.

With that said, and admittedly that is more my error than the manufacturer's, the Party Yacht is a fun little playset. The Party Yacht is like two sets in one. The kids can play with the set like it's a big boat, and the yacht can also ""unfold"" to create a cool little resort, with slides, a grill, a hammock and a jet-ski complete with a harness for water skiing.

Assembly is a breeze, just snap a couple pieces onto the yacht, fold it up (or keep it open) and it's ready to go. While I still think it would've been a smart move to make this into a water toy, my daughter enjoys the set as is."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,I got this through vine but it is not something I would purchase.  My wife said she saw it at Target for $40.  This is not worth that price in my opinion.  It looks cool.  The different hats make Elmo say different things which adds new flavor to a toy that really wouldn't keep my kids attention.  They were excited to get it in the mail.  My 3 year old was done with it in less than an hour.  Our 15 month old occasionally drags it around but really doesn't play with it.  It is shedding and was doing so right from the time we got it.  I keep finding little red threads from the toy on our living room floor.  It has an on off switch which took me a while to realize but that was my fault.  Overall it is just OK.  I like elmo but honestly he is just going to sit here and collect dust.
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"This thing is pretty easy to assemble, and pretty easy to charge.  Got it to take off, but it tends to bank pretty hard in a random direction even in no wind.  Lots to compensate for.  Well, there was a lot to compensate for...before it caught fire.

After about 5-10 minutes of flying, it came in for a landing, tilted a few inches from the ground, caught the grass and flipped.  Not a hard landing at all, and no physical damage.  On picking it back up, the propellers were spinning at full speed (with the throttle off) and smoke was coming out of the battery compartment.  I quickly removed the battery, and could see where the circuit board had caught fire.  So, this one is being retired after one use.  I'm not risking hurting someone or damaging property.

On the other hand, if you're looking for something to catch fire in mid air (maybe for a movie or something), this could be the perfect product for you."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"Got this for my 3 year old son actually, as he loves all farm animals - horses included.  It's very cute and he just loves playing with it.  He has 3 large Breyer horses that fit perfectly in the stalls and he loves to play with his ""baby"" horses in the fenced in yard.

However, the prongs that hold the stall doors in place break VERY easily - 2 of 6 are down for the count within the first month. One broke through play - granted, he is a 3 year old boy and is not exactly ""gentle"" with his toys - but the other broke during assembly.  It was easy to put this barn together so there was minimal force applied.  I contacted Breyer for some replacement doors, but was informed that they do not have a parts department.  My son probably hasn't even noticed that the doors are missing so I didn't press the issue, but it's till annoying.

But again, cute barn, gender neutral, and I would buy it again, considering the price."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"We bought this thinking it was a good price but really for the same amount, you could buy materials for many more bracelets. This one only  lets you make the 5 or 6 that you see.

We bought this for a 9.5 year old. She couldn't really understand the directions. I read them and once I got the knack of it tried to teach her, but she couldn't do it. In the end I had to make them myself and give the bracelet to the original gift recipient. Thus my thinking that it would have been cheaper to buy the materials and make the bracelets the gift.

I will say, we didn't know the girl well ahead of time, so we weren't sure of her crafting level. At 10, friendship bracelets were all the rage in my school, and all the girls were making them on the playground or between breaks. But not every kid is adept or interested.

Additionally, for just a small bit more you can buy a kit from the same company which contains many more materials. Skip this kit."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"We like this electronic version alright. The convenience of the cards and electronic banking make game play faster and smoother, but this game is very different. Life tiles have been replaced with action cards and the action cards are so different. They may say something like ""Have a dance contest with another player."" and both will spin the wheel and highest number takes the prize. With younger children this will be great. I imagine they will enjoy it and the focus on family bonding for this version is awesome. However for just adults playing it's a bit too young. Also the values are crazy. I believe there's a card that says throw uncle max a birthday party pay 50K! Must have been some party! Obviously the older versions had exaggerated prices but this one is even more so. The only real complaint I have is that mine came in a cheap and very thin cardboard box with flaps, not in a shoe box style box like most board games. Ours has already ripped and we now keep the game in a basket."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"I am a father of 8 children, and we swear by the leappad learning system. With that said, the ""Little Touch"" is a great device with some caveats. I bought this toy for my son when he was 1, he was definitely not able to sit and ""play"" it by himself until about 2.5

I would have liked to have seen a better solution than the ""go"" button for turning pages, the ""age setting"" is in the book instead of on a parent-switch for this function.. My child happily changes the age setting as often as he presses anything else. It was a good idea, not having a stylus and it works fairly well.. Although my 9 month old smacks the pages and it doesn't actuate the touchpad.. It requires a ""poke"". The books are quite sturdy, they clip into the pad and are made of some kind of plastic material, very sturdy all in all. This is a great toy, and I'm glad I bought it, but it's not on the same page as the ""My first leappad"", ""Leappad"", ""Quantum Leappad"", or ""iQuest""."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"This is probably entertaining for a baby who can sit but is not mobile... although it might scare babies that age. Considering the price of this toy and the added cost of the battery needed to run it, I say pass on this toy and buy something else! My daughter got this for her birthday and has played with this probably 15 whole minutes, if that (she is 16 months old now). The motor is so loud you can't hear the music over it, and it just doesn't keep her attention for long at all. The loud noise may scare your kid, it has scared my daughter a few times when she hits it by accident. One thing I like about this toy is when my cats accidentally hit it it goes off and it is pretty hilarious watching them scurry, since they aren't supposed to be in her playroom. Giving it three stars because it does what it advertises it does, but pretty much is boring and not very entertaining for my one year old, and there are cheaper and more entertaining toys out there."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"Good concept, rainy day busy box/travel box, but my 9 year old got bored after about an hour and hasn't played with it since.
I was thrilled to see this item available because I loved the mystery activity books in my youth that would come with the special pen that uncovered the hidden messages.
My son was excited when I showed him he little brief case and it enticed him away from the tv and video games.  He sat engrossed in the activity books for about an hour, but said it became too redundant And boring.
He liked the red magnifying glass that revealed secret symbols to help him with the activities and the decoder pens.
The product is well packaged and  intriguing for kids to want to pick up to open (which is common with most Melissa and Doug products).
The age range for this toy is probably 7+. I'm disappointed as a parent because my child has not shown additional interest since the first day of opening this product. As I mentioned, I think it's a good concept at a good price point, but not sure if it's worth an hour of entertainment."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"1. The best thing about this globe is the gorgeous colors.  Oranges, blues, gorgeous.
2. The textured terrain is wonderful.  Very instructive for a kid to ""feel"" the mountain ranges.
3. I have two complaints:  1) when it arrived in the mail, there was a chip in the paint, so the light seeped through. If it comes new with paint chip, it's going back!  2) this globe does not spin freely, and we all know, the best fun about a globe is the spin, so a kid can spin it and randomly point her finger to see what country she should go to....  that's the fun.

So, I'm still hunting for the perfect globe for a present for my grandniece, one that lights up, has a good easy spin, and has topographical texture...  the hunt continues...

forever,

Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"My daughter liked the included doll and pet (note its only 1 pet, not 3 like the Amazon description says). She didn't like the house itself much and i cant blame her. Its a cute little house but one that is badly made.

You pretty much need to assemble everything which is a pain. I'd say it would be a good exercise for a kid but my 12 year old couldn't assemble it on her own. I probably spent 45min assembling it. Alot of the pieces didn't properly snap on and i have no doubt it will pop off with continual play. The door is horrendous, it easily open ands doesnt stay closed. The background of the house inside is just a cardboard you slot in. The finished product is a good size; not too big or too small.

They included like 50 small stickers and my daughter loves stickers though so she did have alot of fun sticking them on the house and customizing it. She is also having alot of fun with the mobile app. But in the end, i wouldnt recommend this. If you kid really wants a LPS toy i would pass on this."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"I kept her in the box for a long while after I got her . And I finally had enough to buy me another Ikea display stand, to Separate all my Transformers and all my action play arts kai Street Fighters and Wonder Woman and Bat girl. Anyways as I was about to pose her in a action pose I moved her left arm and her joint snap off.. 1st I was like WFT.....For a 70 plus figure I expected better From a popular manufacture. Anyways I contacted the seller and We are  in the process of getting a replacement. Dam the headaches. Makes me weary of buying these figures again. And then I read some of these reviews in here and one person had the same problems as me. So I  Decided to post my own review. When I get my replacement, I'm not sure if I wanna open her up or just leave her in her box.

To the future buyers be weary of these defects and I hope that my review helps out, I mean for a 60-80 bucks figures. Tis is a problem. So I gave this action figure a 2 out of 5 star"
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"My girl, who is 7, is in that ""mommy"" stage and really wanted this doll. It might be good for younger children, but at her age it just wasn't a good match. As some others have mentioned, the clothing does not come off. A huge part of the fun, at least with my child, is dressing up her dolls in different outfits. Also, because of the way the clothing is sewn on, it does not lift up far enough for you to really put the diaper up around the doll's bottom. So the diaper was a waste as well. The quality of the doll's hair was horrible! She looked like she was going bald! If I had to do it all over again I would buy a Baby Alive. At least you can change their clothes, they actually have real looking diapers (not like this one which was a thin piece of cloth, not even resembling a diaper) and they actually eat and drink. This one may be a hit with younger toddlers but not for girls who are older than 5. And even at that, I would NOT pay $45+ dollars for this. It should be $20 at the most."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"I think it's a nice little rattle that my 4 months old daughter plays with for few mins each day. It lights up and the lights change colors everytime you tap it so it captures the baby's attention. my daughter loves trying to put the face part into her mouth but since she cant, she settles with just sucking on the ears. She also tries tosuck on the middle part but she cant get to it.. its not long enough and with the two bulky ends, it just doesnt fit her face. When I was buying, I thought it would be a good teething toy also but that didn't work out too well. There is also a mirror on the bottom that my daughter looks at for few mins but why look at the small mirror when you have a color changing face!  Its a cool toy that does what it says it does but at the end of the day, it is regular toy- a rattle, that I am not sure I would pay $20 for. She is just as entertained playing with her $2 rattle, then going out of town on her link of rings as her teething toy!"
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"With the soft sounds and colors, this toy is a superb companion for any toddler and introduce him/her to the subtleties of music. Our 15 months old liked this toy but it is a bit early for him to get engaged with it. It seems to be more suitable for an 18 months old as recommended by the manufacturer or even older toddlers who gain basic understanding of cause and effect and the rhythms in the sound.

I wish the string was longer than mere 9"". The center of the wooden handle with string is about 12"" long in total. That is too short even for average height toddler. Kids do not pull toys with hands stretched all the way down. Most of the time he pulls the string at chest level which renders the toy hanging in air instead of being a pull toy.

It is very good for a sit down play and can engage a toddler if he gets interested in music. Otherwise, as a pull toy it may not work successfully. With the current price range, I would expect that the designers in the company must have thought through this aspect.

Overall build quality if very good and sturdy and I have no doubts about the longevity of the toy when subjected to normal toddler type abuse."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"This dollhouse is a complete pain to put together alone. It would have been a much easier job with 2. Think awkward two finger screwdriver holding while suspending a floor with the same hand and using a tiny allen wrench with the other hand. I only had one hole that had poor pre-drilling, so compared to some of the other reviewers, I felt lucky. After the 2 1/2 hour construction, it seems like it will be a nice dollhouse. It seems good and sturdy. The ramp for the garage will likely fall off regularly because of the way it attaches, but its not really a essential element anyway.

Update
3 months later... I am leaving the three star rating.  The garage door ramp has never fallen off like I expected that it would, it doesn't attach very strongly, but the house doesn't get moved around all that much either. My son loves this house, and its played with daily. No amount of adjustments ever made our elevator work smoothly. It got stuck all the time, and I removed it entirely. It was bulky, awkward, and impossible for my independent 2 1/2 year to operate on his own. Luckily we have a super handy grandpa, who whipped up some nice ladders with some scrap wood and dowels, and my son has been much happier. Removing the elevator made the lower floor and garage much more accessible as well."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"Okay first off this is not a LOSi product quality bash review because we all know LOSI makes quality cars. This is just my first impression of this particular car for anyone interested in getting one this size for the first time. When I first held the car in my hand I knew that this size scale was not for me at all. For the money it felt very cheap and the controller felt even worse. But that was okay because I was going to keep it anyways for fun around the house on a rainy day. that was until i charged up the battery, got everything hooked up, pulled the trigger. nothing. Apparently i got a bad controller because the car would only move after i pulled the trigger more than once forward and backwards to get it moving and once it did the car just took off and once it stopped same problem again. After about 10 minutes of this i gave up and sent it back. Like i said it just wasn't for me but that does not mean it's not for someone else. The cool thing about this car is that it's a hobby grade car which means you can upgrade it with metal parts and better upgrades if you wish. So if your willing to spend the money to do that then by all means buy the car and have fun with it."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"My 8 year old daughter was excited to get this after seeing a commerical. The setup on the computer was easy. My daughter probably could have done it herself. The first disappointment was how it morphs the pictures. I tried using pictures I already had and then took new close up shots but none of the pictures looked too much like my daughter after they were turned into a cartoon. The shape of her face was probably the closest feature but overall I was disappointed because that is the main reason to buy this product. You child can make up a story on thier own and there are other free make you own story sites so the big hook was putting yourself in the story. I tried 2 of her friends, one with very distictive features and most family and friends could not guess which cartoon belonged to which kid. We decided to make a story with the best cartoon kid. I was surprised at the limited choices. My daughter was expecting to design her own dresses and accessories. There were 5-6 outfits to choose from and you had to wear the same outfit on each page. Printing out the story was easy. My daughter and her friends still colored then pages. Overall the product was easy to set up and use but i was not happy with the content. I would only buy this if the price drops alot."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"Should have watched the video posted with the still pics for this toy.  In the pics, especially where the boy is kneeling, there is no background.  Because of this you can't tell that the toy MUST be attached to a wall to work.  See those yellow brackets (one is mid-circle on the right)?  The set comes with sticky pads that go on the backs of these yellow brackets, to attach them to the wall.  My son doesn't have enough open wall space in his room to use this.  Had to send it back.  But, I'm GLAD there was not enough wall space.  After watching the videos, the power boost, or whatever it's called, just makes the car go around and around.  NO interaction by the kids playing!  They just sit there and watch.  Check out one reviewers video for a quick experience of this toy.  The car goes around so fast you can't even see it!  Not the kind of Hot Wheel experience I want for my son.  Also, one reviewer said it was difficult to set up.  Not sure you'd WANT to break it down due when the child is done playing with it due to the difficulty factor AND due to the fact that it's stuck to the wall.  I prefer toys that you can put away after the child is done using it."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"My daughter loves Rainbow Dash and Play Doh, so I thought this would be a great toy for her, but I'm disappointed with it. In the box, you get the Rainbow Dash, a pair of dough scissors, and 6 very tiny cans of Play Doh in purple, pink, green, yellow, blue, and orange. I did like that the Rainbow Dash has molds built onto it, but they are very hard to get the dough out of, such is the case of the dough extruder on the top of Rainbow Dash's head.

The problem with the extruder is that you can't fit that much dough into the hole and when you push down, the door keeps popping open and when the ""hair"" comes out, it isn't in a continuous flow because you have to keep stopping to add more dough, so it ends up breaking off. Pretty much a bummer for my daughter and we rarely use it. I do really like the scissors and we use them even without the pony and can use the raised designs on them to make impressions in the dough. I also wish that the dough cans it came with were larger because once you mix the colors in the extruder for the hair, it eventually turns an ugly dark color from repeated use of the dough. Lastly, the wings keep falling off of the pony. The idea of the pony is cool, but the execution is quite flawed."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"I ordered 4 boxes. Three basically had the same commons in all three boxes and there were easily 30-60 of any given card. The 4th box was mostly Blue (cards massively repeated, many over copies) and the rest of the commons were green. The commons were mostly junk commons (no lightning bolts/shocks/wild growth/counterspell type cards). One box came with 2-3 rares. The others had 4 or 5 but they were largely repeated across boxes. Some uncommon came in sets of four to fourteen. (4 of 11 or more copies) Nothing exceptional. I must have enough prodigal sorcerers by now to assure that they could go into every blue deck I will ever make again without ever reusing any of them. Condition was also an issue on more cards than I expected. The patterns of the commons almost made the repeats seem intentional, especially where five different cards would repeat 6-8 times in one section and then again later. All four boxes were underfilled. Don't waste your money or your time. These doesn't even make for a good beginner's collection because it lacks most of Magic's most important commons. No counterspell in four boxes???? Really? Oh and expect about 20 Circles of Protection. They've been printed in a lot of sets. At least there were 6-10 Healing Salves. Oh, and in 4 boxes, 1 Raging Goblin, which has been reprinted so many times it should be in every box. No basic land, so there is that."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"This little tea set just makes no sense to me.  The tea pot doesn't actually open, so you can't actually pour water into it.  Ok, fine.  It does make a cool pouring sound, but only randomly.  Most of the time it just bursts into song when tipped, and then makes the pouring sound when you bump it with your elbow or something.  It would have been awesome to have the option of turning the music off and just having the pouring sound to play ""tea"" with.  The songs are just strange and annoying anyways.  The cups too, while cute, have two holes drilled on one side.  So, heaven forbid your child actually pour liquid in, if they happen to try to drink from that side the liquid will just pour out of the side of the cup onto their lap before it even reaches their mouth.  The cake stacker thingy is actually pretty cute and fun.  And, my kids love this little set and mix it in with their other kitchen toys.  It was a gift, so we will keep it, but I would not have purchased this for them on my own.  I feel like the makers of this set assume that kids need constant electronic stimulation to keep them entertained, but I think the opposite is actually true. I think a plain, non-verbal, no batteries required set is so much better to encourage open-ended play."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"We have had this for a year which is a pretty good length of time for a bath toy in our house. My boys got this as a gift from a friend for Christmas in 2014. It came without the suction cups to attach it, but I have  a textured tub so it  probably wouldn't have worked anyway. One of my sons has played with this pretty frequently, just sitting it on the ledge of the tub. He mostly pretended, because for it to work it has to be partially in the water. The floating gup that came with this was total crap and grew mold inside it, so I had to throw it out in the first month. The roller ripped in the first week, so out it went too. The rest of the unit has stayed functional, so we kept it. I am careful to squeeze the water out of it until no water squirts out after each bath use. But finally last week,  I noticed the blue tubing looked funny. I cut it open and it was growing black mold inside it. So I cut off the tubing and had to pry the plastic shower head off to get it all off. I then told my kid he could play with the housing like that since now water won't collect in it to grow mold. It is a fun toy, but designed very poorly for emptying. It will grow mold, no matter what you do..... it's just a matter of time."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"Absolutely no customer service, try googling for a company website and you will not find a result. First, after opening the box there was 1 landing skid missing. Second, I tried the propeller guards on and spun the propellers by hand and one for the propellers would rub against the guard. So I tried charging the battery and was going to fly it without propeller guards, landing skids, and without the camera. Plugged the battery in and the drone never got power, no signal to the transmitter either. Tried calling their customer service (which was found on groupon) and they ask to send an email or leave a message. First I tried wrinting an email and after a week I never received a response, then tried calling and leaving a message and after 2 weeks I never received a response. THERE IS NO CUSTOMER SERVICE! Beware of this hoax company. I will now try and google for company webpages before making any further purchases, regarding drone manufacturers. The cherry on top, after handling the body of the drone, the company name smeared from the palm of my hand. Very cheap and not worth the money. This would have been my 5th drone to play with, I have also built my own drones as well. Never had any other issues with other quadcopter companies. Since you can't find a company address or contact a customer service representative, I will probably order a new flight contoller and get it to fly myself, would hate the whole investment to go in the garbage."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"The Bloco product consists of a few cutout sheets of foam, as well as some connectors. I'll grant that it's clever, and the dragons are fairly neat when fully constructed. That being said, I'm not a huge fan. First of all, there are a large number of pieces - 230 doesn't seem like that much, but many of them are small and even hard to find. My 6 year old was overwhelmed, so I had to piece the things together. Moreover, I suspect that the instruction sheet would be a bit much for a 10 year old, working alone to interpret - let alone a 6 year old. If you look at the picture of the kids on the Bloco page, they still have their baby teeth - so they're marketing to younger kids. The foam itself is, by and large, pretty thick and durable, although there are a couple sheets of thinner form that easily tears as well. In some cases, however, removing the smaller foam holes and pieces can be difficult. Regardless, separating the pieces in the foam sheets took a good amount of effort, and assembling both dragons took around 90 minutes - for an adult. The toy itself was OK. If your child likes Legos they'll probably like this as well. In my case, once the novelty of the newly-built dragons wore off, the toy was largely forgotten. So while the Bloco Dragons are offered at a good price, and some kids will love them, I can't give them an unqualified ""thumbs up."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"The Princess guitar is a pretty in pink starter guitar for small hands and short arms; however, there are some reservations that other reviewers also mentioned.

My 7 and 9 year old girls want to learn guitar.  A full sized guitar is hard for them to manage.  This is more their size.  It does need constant tuning- probably the biggest drawback.  My girls are learning off ""Alfred's Complete Kids' Guitar Course"".  It starts with single finger chords: C-G7-G then a 3 finger chord D7, which are fine on this guitar since it only involves the high 3-4 stings(mostly G-B-E).

For full 6 string strumming, there's usually a string that needs to be tuned or one can just ignore it, and let them strum and play to their imagination.  Our strings have not broken yet.  They have covers for the nuts and stickers to id the open string(which eventually fall off- not a biggie).  It's opening is small and the resonance very limited.

I find our girls use this for play, pretend and simple practice.  For better sound, they mess around with our electric quitar on a mini-amp.  For their age group, it takes time to get use to pressing the strings down and toughen and strenthen their little fingers up.  It's all for fun and they're advancing quite well at their own pace.

Overall, consider the cost and what you want out of a guitar- if it is just fun and goofing around with a little intro to the instrument- this one might suit you; otherwise, buy a better one."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"Great theory, but poor construction.  It broke on day two after around 10 total minutes of use.  Two faults:  Poor gluing of the magnets under the alley and weak, unstable wood veneer used on the top surface of the lane......First the side magnet switch got stuck and would not come back up to the vertical position to set the pins up.  I took it apart underneath to find one magnet came out of it's circle and latched onto the neighboring magnet, blocking the triangle of magnets from rising fully to the top.  I reglued it and another one that was loose (only a string of glue kept it from popping out of its socket), and then added 2 drops of super glue to the sides of the others as well.  Problem #1 solved.  Then I noticed in a good light that the pin dots on the bowling lane were all raised slightly (about the size of a fingertip around each) and the king pin spot had a tiny crack in it.  The bumps obviously affect the roll, which is why the ball won't go where you aim.  The veneer must be very thin.  There should be a thin non-flexible substrate under this area, like a small aluminum or plastic sheet, to prevent the lower magnets from pushing the wood up.  OR, a ""stop"" installed in the plastic mechanism to prevent the magnet plate from rising any higher then the floor bottom, as without one the spring pressure bangs the magnets up slightly into the wood.  Still working on this problem.  Very disappointed."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"If you have young WWE fans in your house (I kind of hope you don't, because that stuff is not well-suited to viewing for children!), they will probably enjoy playing with something like this. The recommended age for this toy is 6+, and I'd say that is probably about right. Many 6-year-olds will be able to assemble this toy, though some will struggle with it. Unless you want to assemble it yourself and keep repairing it yourself, you had better not give this to any kid younger than 6 years old.

This set CAN be assembled in many different configurations, and that will give it a bit more longevity in the life of its play. The biggest drawback to this toy is that it doesn't come with a single WWE action figure. It would take two to make it a ""complete"" toy, yet it doesn't even come with one. To me, that's just absurd. Every playset needs to come with one or more figures to populate it, and when I see manufacturers pumping out stuff like this that forces parents to purchase more stuff to even make it fun, it really grinds my gears. The action figures that are made for this playset run $20 each, so you can plan on spending an additional $40 on top of the cost of this set to even make it ""playable."" That makes it a $90 investment for a simple toy that will - in all likelihood - not be a great time consumer for your kids. Ridiculous! There are many better products for you to invest in that will produce longer play time and better stimulation of the imagination than this toy. Skip this one!

I just can't give a positive recommendation to something so incomplete."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"3.5 stars
This is skimpy set. When it is available and I can check it against the actual retail price I may update my rating. But otherwise meh. You only get round track, 3 cars, the controller and some removable decorations--it does have cool noises. I have a Marklin Z scale and an older O gauge by Lionel that I use during christmas time (obviously in different locations because near each other would be pure craziness) so I understand the train prices are more expensive than people realize, especially Engines. And this is a pretty neat and fun for little kids Engine. The Caboose is Bobber style and ok. The engine is a Lion chief Thomas the Tank and is very obviously the highlight of the set. The chirstmas hat makes it that much cuter. The remote is battery power and includes announcements and sounds but no smoke (that i could tell.) The middle freight car is nothing special and feels especially cheap, though to be fair these often do I think in part because of the open top design. The track diameter when fully spaced out is a little over 3 feet. The track is your standard Lionel rack and self stabilizes with the plastic base. With another car and 4-6 pieces of straight track this would be a neat 5 star set. As it is it just feels a little cheap. Lightweight, lots of plastic, not many cars and very small completed track.

I think most kids will love this set, and they can set it up themselves, and make train announcements--my nephew sure did--but I think parents need to understand what they're getting or they'll feel they maybe didn't get their money's worth. Its not quite the grand experience of trains of our youth. Its more plastic, less track, less cars, were bigger and we had to pay for it!"
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"This is a cute idea, but it's not all that much fun.
After the novelty wears off, there's not much to it.
This is a miniature race track with these cars that you charge up, then let zoom around for a few laps.  It's kind of neat.  These teeny tiny cars - seriously there are as big as my thumbnail, have batteries and motors in them.  The set needs two double-A batteries to work; and you ""charge"" up the little car, then let it go flying around the track.  It's a little klunky, but kind of neat.
Once the track is set, you place the car in the charging area and press a lever.  The lever sticks these two prongs into the back of the car.  The back of the car has 2 little metal pieces where the contact is made to charge the car.  Mine didn't work.  I had to fiddle with the wires in the back of the car but finally I was able to make contact.  When the car charges, it makes a little revving noise which is kind of neat.  Then you release the car, and it zooms around the track a few times.  It's cute.  It's also boring.  The novelty of one car wears off quickly.  This set claims you can race other cars, etc, but you only get one with this set.  Plus, it's not like you can make a bigger or different set with this one.  It's pretty limited in how you design or create a track.  If it came with two cars, you could ""race"" them etc, but alone, it's pretty dry stuff.
My nephews like to tear stuff up and re-design their own tracks but this is what it is - a single track.  At least it doesn't take up much space."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"The new board (the one with the round boulders for spaces, vs. old board with squarish spaces) makes it just about impossible to exit the ""endless loop."" They have changed the placement of the ""5"" and ""3"" spaces within the loop--previously, landing on one of these spaces would (unless you got a minus 3) guarantee your exit (in addition to landing exactly on the exit space), meaning you have a significant chance of being able to exit the loop on any given turn. Now, however, the ""5"" and ""3"" spaces will never land you on the exit--so they are pointless! There's almost no chance of landing exactly on the exit space on any given turn, which DRASTICALLY lengthens the game. The game has gone from fun to FRUSTRATING. And isn't the whole point of this to make math fun??

Our ""solution"" to this so far has been to just ignore the rule of landing exactly on the exit space, treating the exit space as any old space and ignoring the whole loop idea. This makes the game super short, but that's better for my 4 year old and she still gets addition/subtraction practice without the torture of drawing the game out for hours. I may end up taking a sharpie to the board and changing the placement of the 3 and 5 spaces to where they are SUPPOSED to be, to make it more playable.

If Learning Resources will either correct their game board or send me the older version of the board that actually makes sense, I will update my review with additional stars, as I think it's a great game otherwise. How did this major flaw make it all the way to production?

Also, I noticed Learning Resources commented on another review recently, stating that the only updates they made to the board were artistic. That is patently false and is the difference between a one and five star game/review for me."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"This game is a mixture between worker placement and area control.  Each turn players place their workers on a variety of different spaces that discover and populate parts of the ""New World"", collect trade goods, specialist workers, and battle opponents.

It can be compared to Dominant Species where worker placement is also used to manage the area control mechanics of a game.  I didn't really care for that game and I don't like this one much better.  I do like it a little better because it doesn't seem as abstract as Dominant Species.  The one slightly original mechanic of this game are the specialist workers that provide bonuses based on what action spaces they are placed in.

I think I just need to stop playing these older games so long after their release because I tend not to like them with a few exceptions.  Worker placement has been refined so much and knocked out of the park by so many games since this came out that this game just seems kind of bland and samey even if it was original at the time it was released.  Even the mechanic I labeled as ""slightly original"" where you can acquire different kinds of workers with special abilities has been done and done better by several other games since.

All in all this game was simply bland.  The worker placement piece, which with how much I like worker placement should have been my favorite piece, just seemed ancillary and unnecessary to the area control piece.  The special buildings you could buy didn't do anything very interesting and all of this made the game kind of bland.  The worst was that there was very little to do by the end game, especially the final turn.

It wasn't all bad though.  There are multiple legitimate paths to victory and lots of interesting decisions to make.  It's just not something that has stood the test of time."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"UPDATE 1/10/2016:
Despite the poor quality of these items and the doubled price, I decided to buy some more with plans to reinforce the hilt from the inside to withstand normal play.  The sabres have changed!  The buttons now have different and LESS DESIRABLE FUNCTIONALITY.  There is one switch that has an on/off position.  When in the off position, the other button does nothing.  With the on/off switch on, the other switch toggles between on and off- pretty useless!  The saber cycles through the colors and the sounds (which are, at least, still Star Wars sound effects), so that you can no longer select which color blade you want.  What self-respecting Jedi (or Sith, or Ren, for that matter) would carry a saber which has a random color with every swing?????

ORIGINAL REVIEW:

One of the sabres arrived broken out of the box with a tiny piece of the plastic at the butt end of the handle where the speaker is located broken off.  Otherwise, these were (WERE) super cool and fun out of the box.  It goes downhill from there.  Fast.

All three failed in some way after just hours of play, one failing literally within minutes.  On two of them, a flimsy plastic fin broke loose inside the battery compartment, allowing the batteries to migrate around inside the handle, rendering the lights and sounds inoperable.  I was able to repair these two somewhat easily by unscrewing the handle and gluing the fin back in place, but the fact remains that they broke after just a couple hours of moderate play.

On the third sabre, the sound stopped working, again after just hours of play.  I have not attempted to repair this one, and have not opened the handle to see if a solder would fix it since I don't have a solder gun anyway.

Spend a little more on something that might last at least a week.  No, I would not buy this again."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"I was a big fan of the Dinobots as a young child growing up in the 80s. My favorites were Grimlock and Snarl, but Slag was the first one I owned and he still has a special place in my heart because of this. Well, the Bey-verse Slug is NOT my Slag. This Transformer is much smaller and is brightly decked out in purple and red colours instead of silver, gold and gray. As much as some older TF fans like myself may want to compare AoE Slug to classic Slag, it really is apples and oranges. That said, if you WANT a Dinobot closer to your childhood memories, do a google search for FanToys Scoria. This third party Slag looks like the original but has the articulation and poseability of a modern Transformer. It'll also set you back two hundred bucks, so this $9.99 Slug may sound better and better after that revelation

Slug (SLAG!) is a pretty easy transformer to well, transform. His modes are pretty easy and obvious to shift from one to the other. The Dinosaur (triceratops) looks fine if a bit garish. My wife likes how colourful he is and once you get past the G1 Dinobot paint scheme that is more than likely embedded into your head, you'll be okay with it. Paradigm shift people!

Robot mode is where Slag falls apart. Part of it is indeed my own preconceived notions. it's weird having the triceratops head as shoulder pads instead of a helmet for example. Other parts are just bad design. Slug's robot head is just kind of a blob amdhis front dino legs are just hanging out on his side in robot mode, making Slug look more like Shiva than a Dinobot.

So all in all, the price point is nice and when you get past the G1 expectations in your head, the dino mode of Slug is pretty decent for a Bey-verse figure but the robot mode is really lacking. We'll call it a thumbs in the middle here."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"OK, so first of all, as a calendar: I was annoyed that the numbers were all out of order. This made things difficult to find. I was also annoyed that the pictures on the front seem to indicate what will be behind which door, but then they weren't accurate. Now, all that said, it was nice that each door had a compartment tray behind it, and that they doors had directions on the back of the paperboard for each one. Each bag was also labeled with its number, just in case things got misplaced.

Now, as a Megablok set: I have really enjoyed Mega Blok's interpretation of Star Trek and TMNT characters. This set is a bit below the standards set by those previous sets. You only get 158 pieces, which isn't a terribly good value compared to other sets. Many of the pieces here are uninspiring to say the least. A bush? A weapon holder? There are, at least, three main characters to be had, Shredder, Casey Jones, and a turtle who can be switched via headband between all four characters. But the figures themselves are a bit below the standards set by other iterations. The legs don't move as well, the hands pop out of the arms for some reason, and assembling them is rather difficult for a kid, and even for a grownup, due to the difficulty of popping ball joints into sockets.

For the money, I'd prefer to see twice as many character figures and a lot less filler. My son, turning five in a few weeks, did enjoy that he could put together the simpler items on his own. But overall I think this represents a poor value compared to the other superior Mega Bloks sets in the TMNT family, such as the Krang set or the jungle tank set. And compared to other Advent calendar sets, such as the Lego Star Wars one, this is a poor value as well, as that set has 100 more pieces and 9 minifigures compared to 3 here."
Toys_and_Games_5,negative,truthful,"When the MH dolls first came out I thought. ""With the way they pop on and off, why not do them all like this and make them interchangeable?""  yeah great idea right?  No, not when Mattel is being greedy. I made the mistake of buying almost everyone of these kits. God Help Me!  I got completely ripped off. They are cheap, the wigs look like crap, the arms and legs are loose, and the hip joints break with little movement. I cant believe that Mattel has gotten so cheap. I mean first the first set of MH dolls end up breaking like crazy, then this?  Come on Mattel don't you have enough money????? Do you really have to rip off us parents this close to Christmas????  This set was NOT worth the money, and I didn't pay hardly anything for it at the store. None of these sets are worth a flip. I might as well toss them ALL in the trash or had just set my dollars on fire in the store. I will be very cautious in buying ANYTHING new from Mattel that is MH. So parents just beware. If you buy any of these kits just know that you are getting half of what you pay for, if that. What is next?  A pile of crap with the MH logo on it?  Really Mattel, really?  This set is even worse than the others and I bought them all unfortunately! The wings won't stay on, none of the torsos look good with any of it. The wig is cheapy, it looks like crap. the dress looks like it is cheap and it isn't even. The velcro is off to the side and you can see it from the front. It just looks terrible. The legs and arms, like all of the others, won't stay on. So just save your money, just wait for the real doll."

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"Very nice shirt but not true to size at all, not even for slim fit standards"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,Zipper hard to use.  Inside material would tangle.  I do not recommend this bag.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"The piece is beautiful, but it didn't lay flat on my daughter's head and looked awkward."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"Horrible fit. I will never purchase this cut again, Grandma panties. Just gross. Ill fitting too."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,I order them 9.5 instead of 9 that is my regularly worn and still too small
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,Minus one star for the strong yuck smell! Another star cause they are definitely not leather
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"The shoes looked like the others that I previously purchased,but a bit more expensive than usual!"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,Looks a little clunky and a bit small I would stick to the regular leather chuck Taylors
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,These shoes are too wide. They make your feet look crooked. Horrible customer service.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,They look comfortable and well-made but I found that they were too narrow in the toe area.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,I loved the look of these sandals but unfortunately they were just too narrow for my feet.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"I mean is OK. Is not what I was expecting, but is OK. It does the job!"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,The top looks awfull unless you have big boobs. The bottoms run small. Couldnt even wear this.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,held up through nursing school. the pen light is junk just like most pen lights are anyways.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,Stone fell glued it back on looks nice feels cheap but can't complain price seemed almost fair
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,This bra does not offer the support I was looking for.  Okay for smaller size cups
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,LOOSE fit and kind of heavy. Would be great if you wear them over thermal layers I guess.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,The silver is already coming off I've only had it for a month bought it in June 2017
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"I put in ""extra long socks"" for my search, these things only came about half-way up my calf."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,I bought it 3 months ago and it is already stretched out. But was cute in the beginning
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"Shrunk considerably and don't  wick sweat anywhere near  as good as hiking socks, but very comfortable"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,very much too small and fabric much thinner than I expected. Pretty color and includes a cute necklace.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"I returned because this shoe fit like a mans.  Way to big to be a women's 81/2,"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,Nice hat but runs very small.  Wish I hadn't removed tags so I could have returned :/
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,I purchase the largest size available but it's still runs small.  It did not meet my expectations.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,They are cute but run small and narrow. You can't wear these shoes all day. Order a size up
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"It's a Christmas gift, so not really sure how it will fit. But it looks like the right size."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"this is a really little shirt, certainly not a dress! I'm 5'4 135 and the small was too small."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,Cute style but not the best quality. Gemstones fall off easily and zipper on back of sandal gets stuck
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,Sadly not sewn well. One pair fell apart as I put them on. Size was fine just poor construction
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,I was thinking they were more compression than they are. They are nice and soft but they provide no compression
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"Nice looking slipper, not that comfortable, and started falling apart. ended up buying a cheap slipper from the neighborhood ""Mart"""
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,I have bought At least ten pairs and these are just wrong i strongly do not recommend this product sadly
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"I could get this top on, but the fabric was stretched so much that you could see right through it."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,So after a year or two one of the zips decides to fall off so now it doesn't zip properly.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,A little different than I expected the stone for a lapis ring.  The silver was more shiny than antiqued.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"My 3 month old can't fit in this hat! It's super cute and soft, but for a tiny, newborn head!"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,i haven't even used it for two weeks and the right strap has ripped and theres hole on the bottom
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,bought this for my wife and she was surprised to see how small it was.  Had to return it.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,The strangest bra ever. This bra made me look like I had torpedoes under my shirt.  I returned it.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,These shoes are adorable. But the problem is they did not last long.  I would last for like 5 months.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,Neat idea but the fabric is too thick and the chest piece is much smaller than shown; it hardly covered anything.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"This are very nice, I had to send them back. I reorder them one size bigger hopefully they fit this time."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"Compared to the size 10 reef slippers i bought before and still have here, these or a size smaller to me."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"These shorts ""ride down"" for some unknown reason. I would avoid buying them. I only wear them for non-activity based ""lounging""."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"These are comfortable, but the material seems flimsy and gets dirty very easily and looks old after just a few wears."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"Considering how much you pay for these boots, they shouldn't look like they were made with glue guns. Not very impressed."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,Fits well.  Just a plain black pump.  Not especially stylish but fits my need for a plain black pump.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"the toes were a little pointy for my taste, and the calf was a tad tight, but most boots on me are."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,I bought an extra large and it is too small for my boobs! (40 D) Other than that it is really nice
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,The boot is comfortable but in one little snow fall inside the boot got wet. My sock was wer at the corners.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,DID NOT LIKE IT AT ALL I HAVE SENT IT BACK WAY TO BIG FOR MY FOOT I DID LIKE THE LOOK
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,Purchased as a gift for a baby shower. The parents loved them. They are super cute and seems comfy for the baby.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,There was a nail protruding up from the heel that was very uncomfortable to walk on. I should have sent them back.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,This shoe looks great but it doesn't provide the cushion or arch support I thought it would provide. It's ok. But not great.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,Cheap materials (made in Sri Lanka)  that shrunk up in cold water and air drying. Very disappointed in the Calvin Klein brand!
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,Nice display. But the side buttons press too easily.  The band that holds the extra  strap down doesn't stay in place.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"I'm 42B bra size, got a 3X and it is too snug. Nice bra for price, well made. But sizing runs really small."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"too long in the body, very very tight  and prefer a higher cut leg.  item fine, just my personal taste.
item returned."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,Top was too big and butt was too tight.  Wish it had more flow because it looks really pretty on the model.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,Looked as expected but no give in the fabric and it was really to small. Will return to get a bigger size.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,Junk.. way too small. I ordered two other sweaters same size from different vendors and the other two fit perfectly.. this one was horrible
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"Was hoping these shoes would last a little longer based on the price, but they were garbage a couple of months after wearing them."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,This is a very cute hat. It did fit on my 3 year old but it was tight and she would not wear it.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"Second pair I have ordered and did not fit. I
I buy the same size as my first pair.. I love my first pair though"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,I returned the chains that I bought for both my grandsons. The color of the stainless steel was dark and unappealing for a chain.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,I have a relatively small arm so these were no way near as tight as the picture portrayed...more for a muscular arm I'd say
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,These were not quite what I hoped for.  They roll down my belly area and don't stay put.  I got wedgies from these.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"They are so stretchy that i can only wear them one day, and at the end of the day they are baggy and falling down..."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,It is nice and warm and comfortable. My only issue is I have to keep pulling it up in the crotch area. It slinks down.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,These socks aren't as thick as you are led to believe. I really liked them until they started getting holes in them after 3 wears.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,The length of the arms and legs were a little shorter than I expected a 6x to fit.  But nice quality and great value.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,I was not impressed with this dress. Cheap material. Cheap look. I kept it since it was cheap and I wear it around the house.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"Review for Brown: Descent quality leather for sure, nice buckle, but rather narrow width and extremely shorter for standard length make this brand-named belt ashamed."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,I normally wear an x-large for all the T-Shirts I have purchased from Adidas and others.  This shirt felt like a medium at best
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,The bead I received was so pale it was barely green at all. It must have been very poor quality jade. I immediately returned it.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"The color nothing like the picture
The shirt is small I'm 5'2 120 pnds and Medium didn't fit! The fabric is silk see true
Buyer be ware!"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,Slightly disappointed with the quality of this sweater overall. I know it is advertised as a V neck but everyone knows the military/police wear crew collars.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,It is nice fits great but short can't wear it out. Hugs the body nice.looks good on her but too short.she is 5.6 talk.fun for home.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"Seemed to be a tad under 1-1/4"" - I wound up sending it back right away because the fit was a little sloppy on my buckle."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"Bought for wide width, but disappointed.  Last year got a pairs of Clark shoes same size and they were perfect.  Disappointed in this pair."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"All of my son's jeans are 30x34, yet for some reason these were just a little too tight and he wasn't comfortable with how they fit."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,Super cute on but wore one time & already material is beading up. Feels like wash & trash clothes. Not happy because shirt is really cute.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,A stone fell out after having it for just one week. and I did not wear it everyday. Not worth the trouble of sending it back
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,the fit was stiff and uncomfortable. I also didn't expect the top of the boot to be so wide and gap. I ended up returning them.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"It's definitely a cute watch and I love the color a lot. However, it is too loud!!!!!! I could hear it when I wear it to sleep."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"Just did not meet my needs, did not seem to suit my feet and were uncomfortable; I returned them.  They may work well for other people."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,This hat looks like it was made for a child. It was way too small - I gave it to my 3year old granchild.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"I don't like how the top fits my daughter, something about it looks strange.  It is a cute outfit in terms of the style and color."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"Polished Green Jade 13 mm Slip-On Bangle Bracelet, 7.5"" Totally wrong size? Not sure how it was measured, both were to small? Returned no questions, no hassles!"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"Just received them today. Fit as expected and are fairly comfortable.
There was two weeks between order an arrival, which is pretty bad.

Will update review after wearing for awhile."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"Ordered a medium for my 33 inch waist. It was too big, I poked extra holes but I love the way it looks and that it doesn't hang."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,Purchased these for my husband who usually wears XXL.  These were very long (below mid thigh) and the arm openings were huge (and he has big arms).
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"It is very cute, but the waist is very small. If your daughter or granddaughter has a super slim waist it will be perfect. these china sizes."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"Hangs too low for me, but I was able to unhook the straps and convert it in to a halter top. Not perfect, but gets the job done."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"Well, you have to wear white otherwise you see right through it. The fabric is so thin anything dark like a lanyard with your ID is very visible."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"The shirt I received looks like it has been through a wash cycle at a thrift store!!
Nothing like the picture. Boxy, not feminine, and an ugly wash color."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,Good quality but the ruffle was too tight on my calf. Although I do have a wider than average calf. Would fit some one with average to slender legs.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,Absolutely so small. I normally wear an XL with no problems but the 3XL in this is too small!  Such a great looking shirt but sizing is TERRIBLE!
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"Had many compliments from coworkers. Holds alot of stuff. Great ""cheap"" price from Amazon. Will see how well it holds up, but right now am satisfied with my purchase."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,I read reviews and was advised to order a smaller size- man... was that the wrong move. Order in your cup size or it will be an immediate return.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,The item is not what I expected: the cross is a bland gummy material instead of hard plastic and it s bigger and thicker than what I wished for.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"I found it too bulky and too hard to use for nursing. My son is 7 months old, still nurses, but this bra is in the closet gathering dust."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,Perfect size. Loved it. The handle broke off and I am not sure I can fix it. I will try though because I really do like size and shape.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,soft but color was off and a strip of purple 1\3 of the way into scarf would make it hard to wear anyway other than around neck....will not buy again
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,These look and feel pretty cheap.  Unfortunately i didn't open quickly and missed the return window with vacation.  Would love to return them.  They also run big.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"Construction quality is adequate, fit is adequate, product not impressive. As a lady that occasionally buys man-clothes, it is always hit or miss. This one was closer to a miss."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,The shirt is ok for the price. I would not purchase it as a great quality shirt! So that is what you are looking for don't hesitate in purchasing it!
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,Super cute blouse but i have learned my lesson that Asian sizes run small. i usually wear a small and i ordered a medium and it was still too small.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,Cheap material that falls apart. but hey what do you expect for $3 socks coming from China. Not happy. Also you can't tell what design is on them.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"Cute shoe but odd fit...heel length was great, but too long between toe strap and end of flip flop.  One shoe fit different than other shoe.  Wouldn't order again."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,Well it was a waste of money for me. The opening was too small and if you have any length on your nails FORGET it! Lost the opal ball immediately. Frustrating.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,Shirt is not sewn as it should be. Uneven and lopsided sides. Looks like material wasn't cut right and they attempted to sew the mess up. Comfortable but looks awkward on
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"Seems fitted for Asian physiques.  If proportions are correct for arm length and shoulders, chest is too tight.  Torso length is also short.  Otherwise I like the jacket."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"Too darn tight!  This is not made for adults; they are made for children!  Unless you weight 90 lb with no meat on your bones, these will not fit."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"Cute, and a nice color with jeans, but I had to send them back. they were way too big in the heel for me, even with heavy socks."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"The material and the feel of it is not all that great. Its clothes for the gym you are going to get dirty and sweaty anyways, so I guess its okay."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,I got it on sale and after 6 months of use I have to get rid of them. the sole is not as strong as I thought but man they are comfortable.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,They were about 2in short length and the waist was an inch or two to small. I found Wranglers that were cheaper and fit perfect ( i ordered the exact same size)
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"Everyone said it was too small and to order a size up. I ordered a large and it was too big. Going to exchange for a medium because otherwise, it's a cute top."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"I got These and they fit nicely, but I wasn't a fan of the metallic gold sparkle. Overall if you like that Id get them Im between an 7.5-8 and these fit well."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"These are okay, but they still slip down my heel.
I let my daughter wear them with her sperry's (she has bigger feet than me) a size 9 women's and she really like them!"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,Definitely have to shape these to your head. It is cute but its just so big. I had to fight with it just to get it to bend to fit my friend's head.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"This vest is okay, but the fabric is stiff and does not flow with your body movement. I only wear it around Christmas so it works, but I would not wear it regularly."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"Attractive and comfortable, but not enough room in the toe box to accomodate morton's neuroma. I typically wear a 9.5, a size 10 was ok with thick socks, 10.5 was definitely too big."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"They're comfy and I like the ""brindle"" color  (it's unique to my pant collection ). However, I ordered 38W X 29L, but when I got it, the tag inside said 38W X 30L."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"This really disappointed me , it looks like advertised but it's very soft no structure to it (floppy) unlike other clutches I've purchased this one I would've liked if it was made with structure."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,This ran a bit too big and it really wasn't that comfortable. After I washed it a few times it really stsrted looking crummy.  Since purchasing I donated it to a thrift store.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,This is so much longer on me than the model. I'm 5'7'' and tried both the white and the green but both are below my knees. Definitely not what it looks like on the model
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"This bra is a little too ""pointy"" & it doesn't fit true to size. It feels stiff & itchy.  I don't think I would buy it again unless I could try it on first."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"It is way to small, possibly perfect for maybe a small person? I am confused because an XL is suppose to mean Extra Large not Small...
One star for soft material and because zero wasn't optional."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"These are good socks comfortable on ankles don't slide down but too thin for my foot cause my feet need more support,for pain and swelling. good for summer. Feet don't get sweaty with this material."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,I got this for St. Patties day. I've lost weight and it was too big for me now but the size was correct. It's kind of made from hoodie material so it feels nice too.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"I am disappointed that this beautiful garment did not fit.  The product description advertises that it will fit up to a 60"" bust, but I was unable to pull it down over my 53"" bust."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,This looks like an okay shoe. I usually wear 990 womens 10. 5B or 10. 5D (whichever I can find in a bright color). These Leadville mens 8. 5D were too narrow across the ball of the foot.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,this is my 7th pair of Jambu shoes size 9.  These fit like 9-1/2 and I have to wear socks to keep my feet from slipping out of the shoes.  So I am disappointed.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"Pretty swim dress but not at all practical for swimming.  It could be okay if you don't plan to swim laps.  Fabric seemed very heavy and cups, although formed, did not offer adequate support."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,I have bought new bal sneaks before and always get EE for larger toe box. These are wider than over the whole length of the shoe than I recall which makes them look big and clownish.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"Ordered large.  Received a medium.  Shirt is not as long as portrayed in pic.  I am 5'6"" and want to wear with leggings.  Don't think I would be able to pull it off."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"SIZE IS NOT ACCURED, YOU NEED TO EXPLAIN THE BUYERS THAT IF YOU ARE SIZE 10, YOU NEED TO ORDER SIZE 11 AND WIDE, BECAUSE I HAVE NORMAL FEET AND THIS DID NOT FIT ME AT ALL."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"Too big on me but the boy short style is great under your slacks or pants. Smooth, no panty lines. The fabric is really thin but rather opaque. Colors are good--flesh, nude, taupe, black. A good set."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"I expected to love this jacket, unfortunately it didn't meet my expectations.  The material was okay, but it felt bulky. And the sizing was off.  Unfortunately my hunt for the perfect red ""leather"" jacket continues."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"Total piece of crap, don't waste your money ! Digits are very small and hard to read. Lock does not open when you set it to 0-0-0 (factory settings) lock is completely worthless. Goes directly into garbage."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"Converse is usually a safe bet, but these literally fell apart with normal wear in under a month. Bought them ahead of time as a gift, so by the time my son wore them, return date had passed."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,terrible. cheapest of the cheapest and looks like it came from the dollar tree. The advertised picture makes it look nice and firm but its flat and made of a flimsy plastic. did not use it at all
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,these shoes are ok but you get what you pay for.  they look cheap and are made cheap but if your looking for a shoe to wear briefly or to match an outfit these will do fine.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,Six pack turned into a five pack but it was just as well. They were way too big. The size does not coincide with your normal pants size. Lesson learned. Check for size chart and take some measurements.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"When I got around to wearing them, they fit, but the shoe laces were different colors and had different lengths. The left shoe lace was so short it would not form a proper bow and would not stay tied."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"This is truly, you get what you pay for, as I paid ~$5 + shipping.

This romper is completely see-thru, and there was an area on the collar / neckline where the seam wasn't sewn at all leaving a hole."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"My usual size is size 8P, but I can also wear an 8R. These pants were too baggy around thighs and longer than a crop pant.  I am short and curvy but these jeans made me look frumpy."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"I decided to try this style as a change.  My mistake.  After a month of wearing them, I've found the button fly is difficult to unbutton and re-button.  Otherwise, the pants fit well and wear well."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,Product is smaller than expected.  This item was purchased twice (one for me and one for another).  Both had to be exchanged and seller requires purchaser to pay for return shipping on exchanges which cost over $10.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"Three stars because they're nice looking shoes; two lost because they are terribly uncomfortable.

The foot bed is too long, the heel is too wide, yet the crossing straps are too tight. I am in the process of returning them."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,I bought the dinosaur set and it's super cute but runs extremely small! I bought a size up but wish I bought 2 sizes up because I don't think my daughter will be able to wear them for very long.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"These shoes were for my fiance. They look great and are comfortable however after not too much wear, the elastic in the back has started to pull or bunch up on the top. That is the only fault with them."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"It is somewhat cute, but very cheaply made. It reminds me of the stuff you get from China for next to nothing. It isn't awful, but nothing spectacular.
I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,Socks are socks I guess but I specifically ordered these colored ones so my husband stops stealing my socks and they came as the same exact ones he has. Oh well.  They just have orange letters and are all white.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"The dress was not as nice as I thought it would be from the picture.  It runs very large on top, I am going to take it in to get fitted...overall, it looks much CHEAPER than what the picture shows..."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"Fits great and is very comfortable, however after wearing it one time, I ended up getting a hole in one of the sleeves just doing regular thimgs around the house. I was disappointed it is not as durable for the cost.."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"It's a very cute dress but WAY too small. Yes, it is very stretchy & a thicker material, but I wish I got two sizes up instead of one. I'm a curvy size 10/12 and the XL was not big enough."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"Cheap, inferior materials.  I had been wearing these for years.  Over the last year (2 purchases), they stretch out, fade, and get holes within 6 washes/wears.  All of Hanes mens underwear is of inferior material and quality now."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"Nice top if you can fit into it. I usually  buy 1x, bought  3x. Wish I bought 5x for a nice loose fit. Can just get into it. Was cheap enough to keep it and hope for weight loss"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"The material is a bit lighter weight than I expected, even being labeled light weight. Which means it doesn't quite hang as shown in the photo. I purchased burgundy, and it's lighter in color (a bit more pink) than the photo shows."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"I was so excited to get these - but, the design is horrible. The bottom of them is white suede or some kind of fabric. They will be filthy the first time I wear them. They are going right back."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,This dress runs on the small side (I wear a 12 and it was snug in the thigh area). It is also thin. If you have any problem areas then go up a size or two. The dress is adorable and is versitile.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"So i bought this bag for my daughter 6th birthday...the bag is beautiful...but the strap got a flaw,the stitching loose...when i checked it was tacked with thread not stitched properly....i don't know what to do...she used it without the strap for her party..."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,I am a big man at 6'2 tall. This hoodie is made for someone who is big and short. The hoodie doesn't come down past my waist I'll never wear it. It's trash. This is a true embarrassment to the Dickie's name brand.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,Shoes arrived on time but in a torn and very beat up box.  Shoes arrived dirty.  No receipt included in package and it appears shoes have been worn.  Dirt all along rim of shoe.  Disappointed to say the least
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"The product looks much smaller in the picture, I really wanted a much smaller version of this considering how sleek and well put it looks. The design is amazing, however the bag was very much bigger than expected, so its useless to me."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"I returned it,One Size fits all is complete false. I am a petite lady so the Garter from the panties to the thigh highs were to long. So if your short this will not work unless you have long legs and a short torso."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"My son wears size 18 month clothing, and size 5.5 shoe and we bought the 2T-3T.  They fit good, but are pretty tight on the ankle.  They are also a lot thinner than I was expecting, so not super great for winter."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"I'm a size 13. Usually size 13 fits comfortably and not tight. I need to order a size 14,these shoes were too tight/small. Shoe quality was excellent and the nike swoosh was very bright and vivid. Order a size up just to be sure."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"It's made of a terrible fabric. Dress Shirt?, forget about it.  The image uploaded by the seller it's very very tricky.
It looks great in the photograph, but it doesn't once you have the shirt on your hands at front of you.
Don't buy it."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"Super cute!! Probably just a tad bit tight if worn with socks or if you have wide feet. The rubber soles came unglued after a couple of wears, so these shoes are NOT durable!! Very pricey shoe for it to not stay well put together!!"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"I read the reviews and thought how bad could it be. It's bad! Feathers get everywhere including your hair. I was supposed to wear it to a costume party, but opted to go without so I wouldn't be embarrassed by a trail of cheap feathers."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"It looks really nice, but maybe it is something to do with teh shape of my feet, the right heel comes out a bit and sometimes feels uncomfortable.. Love the fact that it is velcro and don't have to tie them whenever it comes loose"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"These slippers are for my husband.  We ordered a size 13; but, they're slightly too small and too narrow.  Hopefully, they will loosen some over the coming weeks.  However, for the price, we expected more.  We would not buy these again."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"It's beautiful,  but the waistband is not flexible, my wife could not fit dress over her chest! Buying bigger than your size might work, but it also could be fairly baggy in that case and result in a sloppy look :/ just keep in mind!"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"The concept is a good one, but the execution makes for a frustrating day. The bra rolls up just below the breast and it will drive you crazy. I've tried pulling the bra tighter, to no avail. Because of this, I just can't recommend this bra."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"Very thin, was expecting it to be a bit thicker fabric. Had to mend it, as the side seam had a missed stitching along it. The tea-dying that I did to it worked great! I wanted it to look cream colored with ""stains"" for the costume."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"I HAVE HAD THIS MAYBE A MONTH & THE MAIN STONE FELL OUT AND I HAVE NO IDEA WHERE!!! SO DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE I LIKE IT. SO NOW I HAVE A RING WITH NO STONE, SO SAD!! VERY PRETTY BUT NOT WITH OUT THE STONE! SO UNHAPPY!!"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,The fit and feel of the top are fine but it's see through so I won't be wearing it. I hate bras and this shirt needs a strapless bra. I got the Yellow color so maybe if you get a different color it will be wearable.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"Product is at least one size smaller than stated, if not more, will update if they break in well. But as for now I'm going to try to get feeling back in my big toe. made for a poor shift. Even a short one (5 hours)"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"I thought this was a nice garment but about 2"" smaller around the chest than bras I wear.  I ordered a 38""
as usual but it was much too tight. When I measured it against the 38"" bras I have and this one was 2"" shorter."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"This was going to be one of our ""theme park"" backpacks! It survived one trip, did not survive the the next day. We did not pack anything heavy. the heaviest items were 3, 8 0z water bottles. Very disappointed. I guess I got what I paid for."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"I ordered this ""new"" watch and received a used watch with no face protector and already running its battery. I contacted Amazon customer service and they shipped me another one. Second watch was in same condition so I returned the watches and asked for a full refund."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"Cheap looking watch - I guess because it IS a cheap watch.  I thought I was getting a bargain buying an $80 watch for just $12, but turns out, it really is a $12 watch that I would not give to anyone.  I returned it."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"I also ordered 2E.  Way too narrow--cramped my feet right away.  Had to take them off and return.  Was VERY disappointed.  I have a pair of 2E mesh asics that are VERY comfortable.  Really wanted the non-mesh to work, but no dice."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"I rated these a 5 star before I wore them to school. They are LOUD! Squeak squeak squeak all through the halls. Students turn and look, they are very much a disappointment and a waste--I cannot wear these in public without causing people to turn and look."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,It's somewhat large but not worth sending back  scrubs are always difficult to fit believe it or not!  Brand makes a big difference and where they are made.  check the label...been wearing scrubs for MANY years.  Cherokee has a better quality of fabric though.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"This might be good for reading by the pool, but the lenses are a little small to work effectively as sunglasses in most other situations.  However, my mild disappointment with this specific pair would not stop me from buying a different pair from this manufacturer and vendor."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"Maybe I didn't get the right size, but the underwire is killer.  On the left hand side, it pokes out and it rubs my arm... alot.  However, if it weren't for that, I think I would love it.  It is smooth and offers nice support...."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"I bought this for the light feature as I run in the dark and do interval training but unfortunately the light does not work very well.  When it is turned on, the display becomes very hard to read and so you can't even see the read out."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"I normally love Sketchers shoes.  But these were deceiving.  They were made with imitation leather that looked like rubber and they were a bit big they were very wide at the front.
But they were probably they softest shoes I ever tried on, I wasn't surprised by that."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,Ok tried many pairs of this style found out stout needs 2 sizes up and chestnut needs .5 up. Lots of mixed reviews on sizing. I loved the look a d keep trying until i found one that worked. Cute comfy would be 5 stars if size was correct
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"I received these with the stitching coming off of one of the straps. If I pulled it, the rest would probably unravel, so they got sent back. They felt comfortable. I'd ordered W width, and it was too wide - I might have been able to fit the M width."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"Very disappointed. Im a big moonstone fan and was very much looking forward to receiving this pair. The earrings don't match and one of them appears to be cracked. This design has a beautiful name but the quality is very poor. If I lived in USA, Id have returned them."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"Received the dress in mint condition.  Hang tag stated size 2x, but tag on dress read small.  When I say small, it would not fit a 10 year old.
Returned and asked for another.  It too was excessively small.  Nice dress, sorry it did not work out."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"I've purchased many washes of this size and cut, and I find that every pair fits me a little bit differently. This particular wash (""cast shadows"") is much looser than other washes I own, and they stretch out more throughout the day. (These jeans in ""soft black"" are my favorites."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"Band is unbelievably small, if you have large breasts but have the width of a stick, you should be able to fit into it nicely. Very disappointing. Material is awfully cheap, the knots in the back that hold your straps are plastic... One good tug and it snaps and breaks."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"I really loved this when I first got them, even though they are very long (I am 5ft). However, after just a few washings, they starting pilling big time. I still wear them every now and then, but not in public. They were nice to have a few months post-partum though."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,It's a fine costume.  The sizing runs a bit funny.  This small was too small for my 5 year old boy  He's a bit tall for his age.  But when I bought the next size up it was huge on him.  We had to return it.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,A little to big and wide. I have a normal mens 10 foot. Go to 9.5 if your in my shoes..get it? But seriously go with a 9.5. Also they fit a little loose around the ankles. These shoes are designed for work and they aren't the most comfortable for work.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"Nothing like i expected to say the least. Its super thin material and very cheap looking overpriced costume. I bought this for my nephew and he seems to like it, after hallooween im dumping it. If they sold it cheaper i could have said ok it was worth it but its rubbish."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"Arrived ahead of schedule.  Great value.  Good quality, but at least 2 sizes too big.  I wear a size L which is what I ordered and received, though it fits like an XXL.  Maybe if I wash it on HOT and dry it in a volcano it'll fit."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"i wanted these to work but the wide size was still not wide enough and the strap that goes around your heal is way too long. the sole of the sandal is incredibly comfortable and i love that it is completely black, but the sandal is so loose it falls right off."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,They are not really bad but the leg length are longer than I normally get and the material just seems stiff and noisy when walking even after washing a couple times. They spend a lot of time hanging in my closet just to help remind me why I don't normally buy clothes online.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"The workmanship of this garment seems fine, and if it fit right, I'd be pretty excited about it. I figured it'd be a little loose but the size was on ultra-sale, so I decided to try it. Turns out their plus sizes are REALLY plus-sized.

It's very pretty, and I wish it fit right."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"Size chart is WAY off.  I'm 5'8"", waist size 38 (not sloppy fat, but could certainly stand to lose a few).  So I got a large vis a vis the size chart.  The pant legs went so far past my feet it was like baby dressing up in daddy's pants."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"These are strictly for water aerobics. For that purpose that have a nice snug fit. I did have to take the liner out to improve the fit, but the surface underneath is fine for water walking/running. Do not think they would be comfortable for other purposes unless I exchanged for a larger size."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,Sizing is very different I would caution anyone buying this product. Shipping is expensive so you're stuck with what you get I got a size larger then what was recommended bc I wanted it a little larger not form fitting and still it is much to small doesn't even button waste of money
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,I thought these were going to Stretch like my other 505's and while they do slightly stretch they are not nearly as comfortable as my store bought versions.  I can barely raise my leg to a 70 degree angle.  My other 505's will let me bring my knee to my chest.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"I thought this was just okay. It is nice and thick, but did not keep me superbly warm, so I was disappointed since it was quite pricey. I thought that these wool thermals would be considerably different, but it feels like I am just wearing a thick 100% cotton top. It is also a loose fit."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,The zipper continued to split from the get go...had to deal with it all night  as too late to send them back for a different pair.  The zipper was not lined up correctly- manufacturers defect apparently and I'm not sure if they are returnable now as I had to wear them that night :(
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"Overall I really do like this product its long, its cute, it works, the only problem is that it is cheaply made... I had mine for less than a month and one of the straps broke, its nothing a sewing kit won't fix but it would be nice if I didn't have to do such things."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,I don't get it. On the 4th day or so I ended up walking for 40 min in them. They DESTROYED my feet. 2 huge blisters and multiple cuts on both feet. I definitely don't feel the comfort level.(They weren't too big for my feet. I was actually having hard time sliding my feet into the boots)
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"I wanted to like Salomon shoes. Tried 2 kinds. Seemed to rub on side of my heel. I know this will cause blisters. The other type the toe box was too narrow. I guess I'm out for this brand. Too bad, because reviews and a recommendation from a friend made me want to give them a try."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"Everything is good. Except....

Size is the only disappointing reason. I usually wear US 7.5. I bought UK 6. It runs large.......
Ankle hurts because of the rub with the leather.(All because of the size) After a days of wearing, doubt I should try UK 5. However, it has been wore for a day, guess no way to return...."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"I bought this for my grandson and ordered an XL size.  When the shirt came, even though the cellophane package said XL, the shirt inside was a size L, which is 10-12.  My grandson needed a size 16 which is why I ordered a size XL.  Needless to say, I am returning the shirt."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,They're very comfortable but wow do my feet sweat way too much in these.  I've had these type of slippers before and never had this problem.  For wearing an hour or so they are super comfortable but beyond that they literally get squishy inside from the sweat.  Sorry if that's TMI just being honest.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"It definitely wasn't the worst thing that I've ordered on Amazon, but the quality was so-so  and the sizing was a bit small.  The material was stretchy but didn't really hold its shape.  IT just didn't look good on.  Reminded me of something I would buy at Forever 21 on the clearance rack."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"My boots lasted about 4 months before the rubber heel sole on one of the boots started to peel off. The sole remained intact but loose for another 2 months before completely pulling off. Otherwise very good boot, sometimes the laces fall out of place because the metal lace keepers bend outward when trying to pull them tight."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"these shoes are super comfortable.  I have purchased 3 pairs of these in the last year or so....problem is that they just don't hold up for a longer period of time.  Even the laces show signs of wear after only a few weeks.

the comfort and price make up for these small shortcomings.  Will purchase again."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"I ordered the 3-pack in ""Barely There"" and received a box meant for three pairs that clearly said 3-pack on it, but when I opened it, there were only two pairs inside!  In addition, the color was much darker than what I have bought in the past that was the same color, so I am sending these back."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"They fit as expected but the quality is no where near the other pairs of Maddens I own. It's almost like they are a cheap knockoff version. I have a third replacement  pair coming this week. Hopefully I just got part of a bad batch.
I hate giving a bad review because I love Maddens but these are horrible."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"This product is very cheaply made. I won't even wear the bottoms because they aren't made very well and the top fits extremely awkward, not because of my body type, but because it seems to have been thrown together to sell and ship quickly. I didn't expect a lot for the price but I expected a little better than this."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,The fit was great but the quality of the adhesive was not :(  I loved not having to wear a bra but I had to worry about them coming off which 1 did... For the cost of them I was hoping for a better quality of adhesive. I will not be purchasing these again and do not recommend either.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"I'm wearing it coz it keeps me warm. I usually wear XL for outer wears but this XL is rather large and I had to dart the sweater to fit me. Now, it's fine for me and this is the sweater I grab for daily coz it keeps me warm and snuggly. The quality is good and the packaging is ok."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"Love the look of the shoe, and had high hopes that they would work for me, but I need a wide toe area and a narrower heel.  These were much to wide overall.  If I could wear a normal width in the toe area, I would have kept them.  Unfortunately I had to return this pair of shoes."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"Quality-wise, it was fine. Bright, SO soft, and it seemed well-made... however, it was far too large for my son.  My son is a bit small for his age, so instead of being a little bit it was a lot big. Wound up giving it to a friend and it fit her son well enough that he'll have room to grow."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"Fits OK, may be well made but I'll never know.  The dye or something apparently emits a rather unpleasant odor.  Thought it might have been me.  Switched back to my normal shoes and it disappeared. I could not stand it and I certainly would not want anyone to think that *I* smelled like that.  Gave them to Goodwill."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"I bought a M and it was difficult to get on and off. It might've been okay had there been any areas with velcro/zipper/buttons/etc. that opened up on the bodice to give you some wiggle room. I usually buy mediums and wear a size 6, if that helps at all with sizing. It was fine once I got it on, but a struggle."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"Beautiful ring but I'm not sure that it is IP plated. Durability just isn't that high but is very nice for the price.  Normal IP plating is very strong, but this comes off with minimal wear. Love the look of the ring but I don't expect to get more than a few months wear our of it before the plating is ruined."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"My son is 4 months old and long and skinny for his age (65th percentile in length, 19% in weight): these pants fit him well in the belly but are sooooooooo long!  I'm afraid by the time he fits in them length-wise they will be too tight on his belly, especially since we are trying to get him to gain more weight!"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"Cute hats, but they are way too big for the average sized newborn. My one month old baby who is a bit over 8 pounds still cannot fit into these hats without them easily falling off. Also, the part that folds up at the bottom of the hat easily folds down, so the construction is not very sturdy. They are very cute though."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"Unfortunately, this order was too small. It was labeled as being W38"" X L32"", which is what I do need, but they felt like these were 36"" waist, which means that I need instead a 40"" waist. This means that I have to return these and I have no way of knowing how to do this. The style of the pants were good, though."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"These gloves fit ok,  but you get what you pay for. The finger tips of the right hand had these weird wads of fabric where they rolled it up to seam it or something. They are raveling a bit and I will have to return them.

Ladies, spend a few more bucks and buy a better set of gloves. These are very poorly made."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"The photo here on Amazon shows that the back of this wallet is not leather, but it looks like some type of woven fabric?  I would have bought this already and tried it out but I wish the entire wallet was leather, not just the sides that you open it from.  is the back really not leather also as seen in the photo?"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"I have received a lot of compliments wearing this dress.  However, and this may be because I am tall - 5'10"" - the waist hits too high on me.  If I looked best in an empire waist dress, it would look great, but I look better when the narrowest point of a garment sits a couple of inches lower, at my natural waist."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"My son says the bag is uncomfortable. He says it ""hurts"" his neck. Mind you, he carries a plastic folder (2 pocket) a small snack and 6 pieces of paper ans a single pencil. This all adds up to pretty much an empty bag and it still bugs him. Perhaps its because the straps are at the smallest/tighteneat setting, as my son is so small."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,I really wanted this shoe to fit well. The problem is the top small strip of material that the cord goes through. The cord makes the material bend down rubbing significantly against the top of my toe. I even tried on several more pairs with the same disappointing result. Love the look of the shoe and tried to think of some way to eliminate the problem.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"Like others have said, the stitching is right down the middle of your face so it rides on your nose and lips.  Not that big of a deal once your busy riding the slopes but could be perfect if not for that flaw.  Kept my face fairly warm, for the price it works but would spend an extra $5 next time for better design."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"I ordered these Sketchers in a size 11.5 3E - as listed on the Amazon site. They arrived as 11.5 wide. Now ""wide"" is generally considered to be 2E, so they sent the wrong width. Fortunately for me they seem to fit despite the width incongruity, but watch out. The fit and finish of this HD sneaker is good, which is why I'm not returning them."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"I thought the quality of this boot was lacking. They were stiff and felt cheap. Also, the lacing is really weird: two of the lacing holes on either side are not the usual metal rings you'd expect; the laces go through loops of leather. This makes it difficult to pull the laces tight or loosen them when you want to take the boots. off. I don't recommend."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"Aside from the color looking like goldfish scales or ""prison"" orange and not a lovely tangerine like I was expecting. I was disapointed in the construction. On the first trip the head of the zipper came off which left an exposed zipper head-that somehow got caught on the mesh and snagged it, leaving a hole. They're probably suitable but they haven't been a great fit for me-so far."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"These are extremely cute shoes that j received many compliments on. However, the ones being sent out by this seller are either knock-offs or toms has used incredibly bad quality materials for this design. Just after wearing these shoes for one week, the back has started ripping. The blue from the back started to fade after the first time I wore them. I wouldn't recommend this at all."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"I am having a terrible time finding a pant for my tall, slim son. These a bit big but will do, the negative is they feel like cardboard, super stiff. I really don't want to keep them but with the trouble I had finding something long and slim enough I will keep them but will keep looking for more of a softer material, dress pant that is reasonable priced."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"I Bought a dress from millennium before xs and it fits perfect! but this time the dress was way too big!! I compared this dress with the dress I bought before, the difference is hudge! about 4 inches... very disappointed, I was exited to wear this for valentines :(... im 23 inch. waist, 36 hips, 32 chest I weight 110 (about) I usually wear size 0, 2, xs, xxs..."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"Not a bad purse,has plenty of room, and made well. Just that the way it was described I thought it would be a softer/squisher type of leather and it wasn't. While it felt nice and soft/smooth to the touch it was a stiffer leather than I wanted. Also, I don;t know if it was Lambskin or not because mine didn't come with the Tag like it has in the picture."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"This was a bit big- and didn't shape / pull in as much as I was hoping. I am a larger woman and these do hide some of the bulges when wearing a dress/skirt, but there are definitely much firmer holds out there in different brands. This is great if you're looking for a less expensive, moderate definition, but these are not going to make you magically look 40lbs lighter."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"Ordered for wife who insisted her size would be XL but this turned out to be too small for ALL THREE SHIRTS I ordered for her birthday in October. Will be returning all 3 for exchange credit. She can't decide which way to go right now so will probably opt for straight return for a gift card. Too bad, too. She LOVED the colors, but they were simply too tight."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"I love the look and functions of this watch.  Especially the orange on black that enables you to see in dark conditions.  However, the band that comes with it is garbage.  It is made with super thin, cheap quality webbing.  I tossed it and put a new band from one of my older watches.  So, in summary, good watch but you'll want to replace the band."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"It's a beautiful cover up. The only issue is that most cover-ups freely hang in the front to cover you up.... This one kind of pulls to the back back. It's like it won't cover up your frontside at all unless you tie a sash around you. Other than that, it's beautiful and I still wear it at the beach, I just don't really use it to cover my frontside up."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"As others have stated, these are not the same ol' Levi's. The fit is terrible, the material is thinner and the quality is nowhere near what you would expect from Levi's. I have started to look at Lee and Wrangler as replacements. Also,Harley Davidson now has a line of jeans that are better quality and better priced ... and since I own two Harley's, it seems like the way to go."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"The sash arrives very wrinkled. I ordered sea blue but it was definitely green. Is it pretty, yes. Is it worth the price....no, not much better than a roll of ribbon from your local craft store. Sure, the ends of the sash are finished, but if you are making a belt, just loop the back of the ribbon with some velcro, all in all that runs less than $5. DIY this."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"I ordered a size 10 and the top straps on the pair I received were too small for my medium-width foot.  The straps were so small, that it kept my foot from fully reaching the toe-strap and properly sitting on the footbed.  I gave them to my soon with a smaller foot.  Too bad, because other Croc flip flops I have ordered are great.  These not so much."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"I wear an 8-1/2 shoe so I ordered size 9 (U.S.) in these and they are narrow across the foot and in the calf area. I can barely get them on over thick socks or any type of pants leg. The heel is clear, and I don't like the look. I just bought them for out in the yard. They will do for that, but I would not wear them out in public."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"UPDATE- the O in North Face is blacked out with a sharpie voiding any warranty from the North Face store. They do this to items purchased from a Factory Outlet. Just FYI, in case you are looking for a jacket with a warranty, this probably isn't what you want.
Very warm when I tried it on. Fits well enough to have a sweater underneath, but I probably won't need it. Great jacket, very pleased!"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"It fits and I like it but the sides are cut in a V so it does not hold in any extra you might have under your arm. I also prefer another bra I purchased for post surgery that has straps that hook in the front as opposed to having a metal in cloth slide bar like this bra. Overall it's okay fo rpost surgical wear, but there are others that are better."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,I don't know if people put good reviews on purpose even if they hate the product. This is beyond small. I wear small or maybe a medium. I ordered medium and fits like extra small. I looked like a sausage. Material is cheap and where the tummy goes the material feels horrible not flattering at all and I don't even have a big stomach. i looked like 4 months pregnant. Terrible piece of clothing
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"The shoes are beautiful and soft as indicated, but are somewhat narrow in the area across the front of the shoe where the colorful part of the shoe joins with the black part of the shoe creating a pinch on both sides of the foot. And after couple hours wear it is difficult standing flat on the foot.  You would have to walk somewhat on the side of the foot to ease the pain."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"The ring is nice except it doesn't match the picture.  The metal is a smoke color, not the polished silver color shown.  The darkness of the metal takes away from the luster of the CZ.  I do like the way the stones are set in the channel and not glued in.  I have already ordered a replacement from a different company as I purchased this ring as a ""in memory of""."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"30"" waist, 6'0"" tall. These are just as billowy as my old medium pairs of Hanes, the crotch seam is way too low, and the price is twice as much as what I paid for my original medium pairs. At this rate boxer-briefs are going to overtake my boxers simply because I can't find a decent fitting pair. I mean heck, these things are practically shorts.

Once in awhile even 4+ star products will let you down."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"When I ordered these two weeks ago. However, at that time they were called ""David Archy Men's 3 Pack LOW RISE Ribbed Micro Modal Boxer Briefs...."" And that's STILL how my prior order history refers to them. However, these are NOT low rise! They have a very uncomfortable HIGH-RISE waist that constantly rolls down. I see that they changed the title on this item sometime in the last couple weeks, but not before they fooled me."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"My review is not based on the converse shoe itself which we like but the service provided thru amazon. It is the 2nd time this has happened to me, I clearly got the women sizing but was sent mens sizing instead and they vary by 2 sizes!! So my daughter who is a 6.5 women should get a 4.5 mens size. But when choosing I clearly chose womens 6.5 so I don't know why the mix up."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"I've owned one other pair of Miz Mooz boots, and found their fit perfect for my wide feet.  They have a unique look and always get compliments.  This new pair, however, arrived smelling so toxic that I don't want to wear it or keep it in my home.  I hope this can be resolved.  I had seen other reviewers' complaints, but some customers seemed to have received boots that did not have this issue."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"It's a very pretty bra, and seems to be made out of quality materials, but the underwire is cut too high on the sides so they poke into my underarm. If I adjust the bra so it sits lower, it's too low to offer any kind of support. I would exchange this for another, but I already cut the tags when I realized the underwire problem, so it's too much of an issue to make it worth it."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,I have wide feet and ordered a 5E width shoe. The top fabric was wide enough and comfortable but the mid sole was too narrow and the area on the outside of my foot felt like it was on rolled edge the was going to cause a sore spot on my foot so I only wore them about 5 minutes and sent the back. It seemed to me that the midsole or last was from a narrower shoe.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"I tried on the costume when it came in and it fit, the sleeves were uncomfortably short, but it seemed that it would work for its purpose. I put it on on Halloween and the zipper broke, it would not zip up closed,  and I could see how cheap it was. I was unable to wear/ use this product. ALSO the head piece and mask were unable and I had to buy cat ears and mask separately."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"Cheap (not just inexpensive, but ""looks like it came off a bargain-basement table piled high with other chintzy merchandise"" cheap). NOT a turtleneck , more like a mockneck or a ""funnel neck"". Wish I'd read the description: the ""turtleneck"" is 1 1/4"" tall, not a turtleneck by any stretch of the imagination. It gaps oddly at the sides so it looks like you're wearing it backward. I'm 5'2, 105 lbs, 32"" bust, and it fits like it was painted on."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,I ordered a size up just like one of the reviewers suggested.  Bad idea!  Stick to your size.  Large/xlarge size was so big that i felt like I'm wearing a clown pants.  I was totally swimming in the fleece skirt pants.  Pants is thick not very good material/fabric.  Not what i expected.  Definitely a return.  Giving it 3 stars because it's way too long not meant for shorter than 5'5 in height
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"With athletic socks on this shoe seemed just a little big though I normally wear a 7.5 in Ryka athletic shoes. What made me return them is my heel kept coming out of the shoe when walking and felt like my heel was very low. Even a half size smaller would probably not work for me as i'm used to a small heel. If you like the feeling of a flat foot with a low feeling heel, you'd might like these."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"For the cost, Im really disappointed in the quality. I bought this just over a month ago, and despite care taken while washing the bra is fraying and falling apart. Ive always used a mesh bag, on gentle cycle and I hang dry; it started fraying almost immediately. Ive attached a picture.

Maybe I got a defective item, but regardless the straps that do not snap off are very very thin and made with material that doesnt feel like it would last."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,the shoe is cute when you take out of the box but if you have a thin foot buyer beware this foot is like a blanket it does not fit to your foot the gems on this are on way to much material and it bunches at the top. So instead of looking like wonderful foot jewelry everyone asks why i got them so big I had to cut and sew some of it to make it look at least semi good
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"DO NOT BUY THE SANDALS! At least SNAKE COLOR. THIS IS NOT CLARKS! Made in China. Very bad! I could not walk around my room in apartment, very slippery sole! When I was walking, I felt like I could fall down easy. VERY UNCOMFORTABLE. Another disappointing moment is they are made from synthetic material, but on  Amazon they are made from ""leather""! Additionally, it takes 3-4 weeks to get the money back, you lose 8 dollars to sent them back."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"Garment arrived earlier than expected--a good thing.
Asian XL does fit as US medium but this garment is NOT a slim fit as stated. The sides are straight and don't go in at the waist as the photo shows. The fabric feels soft and has some stretch to it but there is no label with fabric content or washing instructions other than what's stated on Amazon: Hand Wash.
All in all, OK but if it were a slim fit it would be much better."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"I needed extra pairs of these pants as I could only find one pair locally. The two pairs I received were both tagged the same. Neither pair fit like the pair I originally had. One pair I was barely able to get over my hips. There is about 1.5"" difference in the waist when held up together. The other pair is more snug than the pair purchased locally, but wearable. I am really wondering if these are factory seconds sold at full price???"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"This is my first time with the XP. I usually were a size 46. I loved my previous danskos as a nurse on his feet all day. I wiould still be wearing them if not for an accident ruined them.
 I have a high arch and the xp is very tight. The length is perfect. I hoped the cabrio XP leather would stretch with some wear by after two weeks I am giving up. I will try a size 47 and return the 46."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"My initial impression of this shoe was that it was an over-priced, cheap shoe.  I confirmed my suspicions about the price when I went to a local Nike outlet, only to find it 30.00 cheaper.  Moreover, the sole wasn't cut in the same way of the original, i.e., in blocks intended to push apart to provide a natural shock impact.  Too narrow inside and out.  The sole outsole was wider in the original.  Maybe just buying the name here."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"I Hate the Big Toe Piece!  It rubs the big/second toe, at least on my feet.  The piece is too thick and rough.  Sending back for a refund.  Plus, the heel flips over making my ankles suffer because of the terrible design.  Too round and cheaply made.  They are beautiful with the silver embellishments and the leather is nice, but not the foot area or bottom.  I wanted these so badly, but they aren't made for me."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"the band with the silver decoration, which holds the shoe to your foot, its freakishly tight. I guess if you have spider monkey feet, it would fit perfectly. I have wide feet and crocs used to fit perfect. All the ones I have tried recently are way too narrow now. So it looks like this is the end of crocs for me. I really like the material and the fact they don't get stinky, but i cant have my foot squeezed like a vice"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"Tried these for my 7mth old, and they don't stay on his feet.  I tried the 12 month size first and they fell right off. Then I tried the 6 month size, which seem to fit perfectly. Within 30 minutes, both had disappeared from his feet. The reviews are so great that it makes me think that I'm doing it wrong.... Not sure how I can do that. Anyway, I'll probably try them a couple more times with hopes that they just stay on."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"I love the shoes for fit and comfort, but the shoes are beginning to show evidence of the silver color peeling off! They are very comfortable and I can wear them for long periods but they are wearing out, or something. I am fairly careful with shoes and they haven't been wet, or ill-treated. No complaints about the fit or comfort but am disappointed in the quality. Won't be able to wear them much longer."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"I figured for $50 I'd buy this blazer for more casual affairs. It looks sharp and nice color ( I got the light blue blazer). I haven't been able to wear it yet because the second I took it out of the packaging I noticed the strong smell of sweet syrup all over the jacket. Instead of returning it, I thought I'd take it to the cleaners. I haven't had time to do that, yet. If it weren't for the smell I'd give it more stars."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"Very low quality. Does not resemble the picture at all. The dress is flat and lifeless with very bad tailoring. We ordered 7 of these dresses for a wedding and every single one was different than the other. One was a totally different color. One had white lace instead of the colored lace. Some had ribbon around the arms and hem and some did not. One dress was really long while another too short. I guess the point is, this dress is a gamble if you buy."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"Alright, it does say in the description ""ruches sides"", so maybe I should have known but WHOA, this is a maternity shirt.  You can't tell from the photo, because the model is twisted around, but trust me - if you are of childbearing age, people will assume you are pregnant if you're wearing this, no matter how thin you are.  It is otherwise comfortable and the sleeves are long, which is great, but unless I just wore it to sleep in I couldn't keep it."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"WARNING: These will shrink if you wash and dry normal.  I have other cotton tops by other manufacturers also made with all cotton that do not shrink.  But this top will- I would recommened buying TWO sizes up to account for shrinkage.  I had to give them away because after drying they no longer fit in the armholes- too tight.  Also, I did not care for the seam running down the back- I wish they would make it with a side seam instead."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"I have to agree with the review that said these have a bit of a strange fit.  I think the problem is, that they do not offer much support so feel kind of mushy. The other problem I have with them is that the netting material they use for the background of the shoes look very cheap to me.  That being said, if you are wearing them around the house, they are fine.  But with the mushy fit, I would not recommend them for a walking shoe."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"I ordered this sport bra for running, because I did not feel comfortable enough with the regular bra. It is good, but not excellent - in my opinion it lacks in comfort. I can feel it the entire time I am wearing it, it sqeezes to much and the feeling is not good. The good thing is that the straps can easily be adjusted, but the problem is that they only use plastick stick which can easily be worn out. As I said it is a good bra, but not excellent one."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"This shirt seems to be constructed well enough, and the it is of a heavyweight material, but two things bother me. The Large Regular is about 2 inches too short for my liking, and the actual color is nowhere near shown in this picture. I am disappointed, but it's not worth enough to return.  UPDATE>>>>>>>>>>>>> This shirt has been washed for the first time, and the size went from Large to Small, just like that. It's in the Goodwill bag.  I haven't had such a lousy shirt in decades. Not recommended."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"Update: after 2 months of my son consistently wearing these shoes, the Velcro has worn so much that they do not stay put  anymore. Very disappointing. I changed my rating to 3 stars because my son still values these shoes as his favorite pair.
= = =
These are true to size and my 3 year old son can easily put these shoes on all by himself thanks to the dual sided velcro. The Velcro is easy to adjust for a looser or tighter fit around the ankle. Im a fan of Under Armour!"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"These would have been great if the dye lot on the shoes matched.  Though they are a multi-color fabric, one shoes was neon magenta and the other is multi-color.  I'm pretty sure no one wants two different colored shoes.  The fit is smaller than expected.  This was an exchange for a bigger size and the bigger size cost twenty to thirty dollars more for the same shoe.  The shoes that were too small were very pretty.  I will be ordering from a shoe store now and hopefully have better luck."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"I was disappointed. First off when I received the item the box was smashed from delivery for some reason and when I tried on the shoe it just didn't fit right and wasn't the exact color shown. I have plantar fasciitis and the picture just made it look like they had a bit of an arch in them so I wanted to try them, I usually always order asics but since these were on sale I thought I would give them a try. They were just not what I expected and felt bad for having to return them."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"Purchased these for a nice alternative to normal women's khaki work pants. Received them quickly but the product is not what I really expected. The material is VERY thin. I'm okay with the thinness, just didn't expect them to be that thin. Also, the small size is way too big for me. The length is so long that they have to be folded 3 times just to keep from being under my shoes. And the crotch hangs very low. The waist line is quite large as well. Basically, I can't wear them as they fall off or get stepped on constantly."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,This umbrella was very difficult to open and then just as difficult to fold back down. It feels as if after a few openings and closings it will break because of having to forse it to open.  I will not close down to the original size therefore it is a strain to wrap the band around it when it is in the folded closed position.  It will not fit back into its case. Construction not much better than a $3.00 umbrella you can buy on any corner on a rainy day.  It is pretty but not worth it.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"Wow are these small - they're both more narrow than expected, a shorter shoe and a narrow toe box. Not at all like a croc. More like a Naturalizer slide. I ordered a size larger than My mother normally wears but even with that she still can't fit a thin-ish stretch cotton sock into the shoe. The entire top is one giant elastic cocoon - puts quite a bit of pressure on your foot. Unsure if she can even wear them. It's not looking promising. It's not like any croc I've ever worn or bought and I have all sorts and styles."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"If you buy this, make sure to get one that is 2 sizes bigger than you would normally buy I think it is an ASIAN size and additionally on the small side of that. I ordered it to replace an XL that was no longer unusable because the zipper was worn out. The XL was snug, but still fit. This one was a fair amount smaller than the XL even though it was labeled XXXL. When I went to return it, I fould out that I am expected to pay the return shipping for what seems to me to be a mislabeled product."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"Way too small in torso.
 I have 3 other dresses from Ever Pretty, they fit well. In fact they're all a bit on big side.

I did so much research and BOTH dresses I ordered for an important Black Tie Gala are absurdly small around torso.

But TOO BIG in the chest and hip area. I looked at many many photos for this dress and am stunned how far it plunges.

It's very strange because I am a perfect hourglass (37-29-38) and this dress should have fit comfortably.
I am so sad that I will now just go back to buying formal dresses in the real world."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"I so wanted to like this ""dress"".  I am 5'10"" 200lbs. and  normally wear a size 16 or XL and this was large on me.  The pockets are very bulky and the design is awful on a tall person.  The flare out part is really big and on me it hit too high and made my bottom feel HUGE.  I felt as if I were wearing a halloween pumpkin costume with the stuffing removed.  I have several long dresses from Mordenmiss in a similar style and just love them, very flattering, but this one is just very bulky and somehow ""off""."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,I ordered an XL. My waist is 31 butt and hips 46 i'm 5'7. It was hell getting on. I have a very large bottom so it was difficult getting over the humps but it smoothed everything out and it did not make my butt go flat like some reviews said. My waist line improved but it pronounced my luv handles. If I had a shorter torso I think the cincher part of the waist wouldn't push out the luv handles. I you want to use the pee hole make sure its lined up right and if you do you have to wear underwear over the suit.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"I hesitate to knock a product down on how it fit me personally, but in this case I'm making the exception.  I really liked the look of these shoes and really wanted to keep them.  But......

They are so tight across the section from the ball of my foot to the outside (where the shoe breaks when you walk) that I couldn't stand having them on for even a few minutes.  I don't mean a little narrow.  I mean ""can't walk without grunting in pain"" narrow.  Sent them back.

Really disappointed.  I still like these better than the ones I ended up keeping"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"I am a Clarks devotee, know my size in Clarks, and have worn Clarks clog style shoes for many years, so I was disappointed in the fit-very tight across the bridge of my foot, which makes my foot slide back, I am hoping that with some wear they will loosen up, but I am used to out of the box comfort and wearability from Clarks. I have noticed that there are very few clog styles available right now, so I had few choices. Style-wise, I like the look of the top, the heel is a little frumpy. I like my Walking Cradles with a short stacked heel better."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"This swimsuit is adorable! However, I wore it once and won't be wearing it again. I purchased it for a beach vacation and got one days use out of it--however, the color bled and stained my skin underneath the suit. It also rubbed off on my (much more expensive) cover up, and the beach lounge chair I was sitting on.. Additionally, the top is very flimsy and offers no cup support at all. (Unlike how it appears in the picture.) For the price paid I didn't expect much and probably would have given it a higher star rating if it hadn't stained my skin, clothing, and beach chair!"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"These have been my primary tennis shoes for about 3 months. The style is nice, but they just aren't going to work for me long term.

PROs:
- Great for plantar fascitiis
- Stylish
- Can remove insole and use custom orthotics.
- Great for walking

CONs:
- Expensive
- Odd sizing. I normally wear a size 8 or size 8W. These were too long in the toe area, but too narrow and rubbed my little toes.
- The sole isn't as thick as I'd like
- The arch in the orthotic insoles is a little too much for a low arch / flat feet plantar fascitiis.
- They were not comfortable for standing in for more than an hour."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"I bought these for a trip to Jamaica.  They are attractive and comfortable.  They provided protection for my feet while walking on hot parking lot, hot sand, and uneven terrain.  They did not work well for climbing Dunn's River Falls.  The rushing water gets into the shoe and pulls it off the foot.  The band across the instep isn't sufficient to keep the shoe on when you've got a lot of water force.  I'd say to size down if you're between sizes.  In summary:  great for the beach and the walk to the beach but pick something else for climbing falls or other more active use."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"When I first got these boots, in indoor lighting, they appeared brown with a slight purple cast. In natural light, they are most definitely purple. Lots of compliments, until I said ""They look like clown shoes."" Everyone laughed, agreed, but we still like them. However, I will note that the right boot feels a half size larger than the left, which is not usual for my shoes. (In other words, it's not my feet that are different sizes.)
All said, I am keeping them but won't be buying another pair in another color, as I had considered doing before trying them ... unless they become $15 less expensive, and then I'll deal with the size issue."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"Piece of junk. Never buy. It's been sitting idle for almost a year. After that I really needed to check the weight of a suitcase. Put in a fresh battery - just in case. It turned on right on, shown 0 after a second. But as soon as there is any pull on the hook, even the light one of less than a pound it turns off. Tried multiple times with the same result - turns right on but as soon as you pull just a tiny bit on the actual belt it's off. Useless. Way past Amazon warranty so I got 0 use of it - when I actually needed it I've got a dud..."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"Zippers fall directly on the knees no matter what adjustments are made (I thought it might be just my height but read identical reviews on other sites).  The manufacturer failed to properly incorporate the zipper, usually there is a smooth ""lip"" of material on either side of the fabric to conceal the seam, but in this case, it protrudes and is chafes as you walk, impossible to ignore, and would drive me nuts in any situation.  Other than that, the material is very stretchy, lightweight, and slimmer fitting than most other parachute-style convertible pants, hopefully they release a re-designed version sans-rough zipper seams. In the meantime, my search for the perfect convertible pants continues..."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"This fits a little larger than expected. the bottom of the nursing flap does not fit flush to the lower part of the shirt as shown in the picture. I purchased this because I was hoping I could wear it out and it wouldn't be so obvious that it's a nursing top, but it is obvious. It's not really flattering, it's a little frumpy looking in my opinion. That is the reason for only 3 stars. Functionally, however, it works well. It is easy to get in and out of and covers everything while baby is nursing. I have yet to find the perfect nursing top. For the price, I was hoping this would be it."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"I finally got to apply this to a new pair of shoes.  Unfortunately, the cap/nozzle had come off in shipping.  I figured no big deal and put it back on.  But once I started spraying this, I ended up with a ton of it just running down the sides of the can.  So yes, my shoes are great, but it's frustrating I lost so much of the material running down the sides while I was spraying it.  Apparently the nozzle couldn't just be put right back on, though I've done it without a problem on other aerosol cans.  Wish I hadn't waited to use it on new shoes as now return period is past."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"I love the look of this bag!  It really is a nice style. However it does not allow for much give as far as structure.  My glasses case seemed to be too thick and it made the bag look warped for a few days. Closing the magnet at the top helped that issue.  My main annoyance is that the outside is showing wear after only a month.  It has scratches form spots I can not explain.  I am pretty gentle and watch how I treat this bag but I don't think it is a bag that should be used for every day.  again, this is a gorgeous bag, just not for everyday use for me."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"These were bought as Xmsa gifts bc of teh novelty effect and how cute they were. THey are made of a nylon material, like a spandex on the outside, so yes, staining is inevitable.  My initial realction was this little "" breather"" insert near the foot arch, that thing is sharp as sh*T, I think when your foot in in there, it pushes the buckle out so you don't get cut but that should never be part of the design.  I can't  feedback on wearing them since it's not Xmas yet, but the packaging is so cute, it comes in a milk carton.... so unique, I would buy it as a Bday gift for others just out of novelty."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"I had high expectation of these boots considering they were #12 best selling men's shoes. I mainly wanted insulated boots that looked good.

These were NOT waterproof. I tested them by filling the bath tub with 2-3 inches of water and standing in these boots - within 20-30 seconds both the boots let the water in. I am not sure if I got defective boots OR they are supposed to be only waterproof in light rain / light snow kind of situations.
I did the same test with my Timberland Gore-Tex hiking boots and they didn't let any water in - no matter how long I waited.

Also these boots are quite ugly - they are too wide for some reason.

I am going to return mine."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"2 stars for the fact that it REALLY is a MAGIC LIFT as advertised.  Being returned because of how it fits however.  I routinely wear Lilyette Minimizers and Champion Sports bras, so I am used to different ways of supporting the girls.  With this bra, fitted by their instructions, the cup absolutely LIFTED, but everything spilled out the sides, leaving the areas of the top of the cup empty/large.  No way to explain it, but it also did not separate well, so center of bra did not lay against chest.  Clothing made me look high and pointy.  I have none of these issues with the other bras, so this just isn't a fit for me -- 36D, mid 50's."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"1. Like other complaints already posted, the US size was actually a 2nd step down...not just 1.
2. The inside fake-shirt is a bit of material sewn onto ONE side of the front collar, so it's obvious there is no 2nd, inside layer. So at the top, just the button-side got the extra material-flap to present the illusion of a 2nd shirt - BUT NOT the shirt's left side. SO stupid-looking!
3. I tried to return this and the customer service was bad - To return, you will have to pay for shipping costs and they will not offer apologies. They will condescendingly blame you for not reading the ""clear description"" of their product.
4. ...on the plus side, the stiff, cheap cotton makes for good cleaning rags!

Total waste."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"I ordered two of these necklaces in the 18 inch length. One was in black and the other in dark blue. I wish I would have ordered the 16 inch length because I like the necklace to sit between the collar bone and the 18 inch was a bit too long. The name part of the necklace is really beautiful and I think the black one looks elegant. However, the chain is rather cheap looking and takes away from the necklace. Overall, for the price I guess it is worth it, but I would have gladly paid a few dollars more  for a better made chain with it. The shipping took a long time, too. I had to wait almost 3 weeks before my package arrived."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,I am currently deployed and I was excited to receive these but when I did I was quite disappointed. The inside bottom sole of the right shoe is lifted from the bottom of the shoe and not fully glued on. I can lift half of it off. I'm nervous to wear these because I feel that the inside will get worn pretty fast and start sliding and coming out easily oppose to if it were made and glued down properly. I tried them on for a brief minute to see if the sizing was good and that was fine so no complaints there. Still not sure what to do with these. I'm really debating on sending them back but the process to do so from overseas is a little difficult.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"The wallet that arrived to me was not very well made. After inserting my credit cards...and I only put one card per slot, I noticed that some of the stitching seemed to be coming apart. At closer inspection, I realized that the machine/person who put this wallet together just missed the seam altogether. Kinda like buying a cheap t-shirt on the side of the road on your way to Florida. You feel you got a great deal because you bought 5 shirts for $10 bucks...until you actually put one of them on and you find the big hole in the armpit. I give it 3 stars because it looks nice and the leather is soft. Just wish someone took the time to inspect these. I quess you get what you pay for!"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"I purchased these to help me make my boos stand tall and to avoid kinds and creases in tall boots. These inserts do the job. Just fold them and insert into the book shaft. They even work on my soft over-the-knee microfiber boots. I do, however, have 2 minor issues. The ""hook' mentioned in the description, is actually a loop of plastic. You would still need something like a hook to hang the boots off of a rod or another hook. The insert is also pretty slick and easily slides out of my boots, when I hold them by the loop.... so hanging from this loop may not be possible, to begin with. (Maybe I'm doing something wrong?) I ended up buying separate boot hangers and attached those to the boots AND inserts."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"The costume was cute the gloves fit pretty well and the dress itself was very nice my biggest complaint was that the dress overall was tight.  I am grateful for the stretchy fabric which allowed me to still wear it and be comfortable so I would recommend ordering larger than your size.  another pet peeve was the amount of glitter coming off of the dress on to my skin and when I took the dress off all of the residual black glitter .

Another reason I gave it a three was for the wig it was awful it was a few pieces of yarn barely could cover my head and didn't look right and not to mention all of the glitter that kept coming off of it everywhere and the strands of yarn that also fell out."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"I know it indicates that these measure a 1/4-inch, but having a visual would be would be useful. So it would be nice if Amazon included an image showing these in an earlobe to give a better indication of their size. They are quite a bit smaller than I expected. As someone else mentioned, they would work perfectly in a second piercing, as they are about the size of a stud. That said, they are cute, but I probably would not have gotten them if I knew how small they were. Also, they look a bit crude to me. I got a fleur de lis necklace when I was in New Orleans and it is so beautifully made, with a lot of attention to detail. I did not think these had nearly that same level of detail or refinement."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"This hat goes perfectly with the ""queen of hearts"" costume. It adds some cute flare for pictures. However, it did not work to wear the hat all night. The hat portion slides onto a headband. The hat gets very top heavy and makes the head band slide around on your head. Eventually if I didn't hold the hat in place it would fall down to beside my ears, if not fall of completely. After 30 minutes of use the hat broke completely.
The company did replace the hat, but the 2nd hat came in broken as well. I was so frustrated with return/shipping I just kept the 2nd hat and fixed it myself. I would not recommend that hat unless you would like to wear it for pictures only. To wear to a halloween party or dancing it does not work."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"I'm a 32F, but usually find that most 32DDD's will fit me more comfortably. That said, I thought this bra would be a winner. They offered my size, and it's such a cute bra (a hard find for sizes D & up). Unfortunately, if you are like me, this bra will absolutely not fit you. The 32DDD is more of a 32 C or D. Especially with all the padding. When it arrived, I took one look at it and knew it was a dream best to be forgotten. Other bras in this size that I bought fit me fine- the Wacoal 32DDD was perfect, but this one particular bra was just so outrageously the wrong size that I want to warn other women: If you are a 32D or up, this bra is not for you, no matter what the sizes say."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"I wear an 8. 5 or 9 and a 39 was way too small. The Makenna style seemed to run a bit more narrow than the regular Dansko clogs that I'm use to. In the photo, I really liked the wide strap, but it seemed bulky for me at the ankle and less dressy than I thought they'd be when I tried them on. In the end, I preferred the narrower strap and the width of the clog style Marcella Dansko and chose a 40 rather than a 39. (I have 4 pairs of Danskos which have lasted for 10 years and when you try them on in a store there is slight size and width variation even within the 39's because they are individually made, so on-line, maybe it is always best to size up if you are between sizes."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"Anyone thinking that the quality of a $15 dummy gun should be up to expectations of quality to a $500 prop replica is a bit ridiculous. This thing is made up of two halves that are glued/screwed in place (mine had a very tiny gap, but didn't matter since it's just for an accessory to my trooper armor until I get a better one on order). The trigger does NOT move. It's a dummy costume gun, nothing more. Some black spray paint can fix it right up for a quick make-do E-11 (inaccurate, but better followed by than the Hasbro). It's worth about $10 personally due to absolutely no functionality in movement, but for what I needed it for it will be fine. If you're looking for something screen accurate with sturdy craftsmanship and great detail, please don't even bother. Rubies. That's all you need to know."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"I purchased this shoe from 6pm.com for $22.99. I wear a size 7 shoe. I bought the size 7. I love Ryka because they seem to fit true to size and are well priced. I love the style of these slip on shoes. I bought the brown/ bronze color. The shoe was slightly short. Not uncomfortably so, but I like room for a sock liner. Not with this shoe. The worst thing about the shoe is that dip in the heel. Somehow that dip makes the sides of the shoe gape open. Noticeably too. I don't know how the shoe would do with a wide foot. My feet are medium width. There was no side support with these shoes.  They looked like I was wearing a shapeless bedroom slipper. I'm returning them. Three stars because they're lightweight, great material, beautiful color and I like the slip on style."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"You'll need to loose a few pounds to fit in this if you ordered your regular size. The material is a very stretchy spandex material so it stretches to you but we all know thats not attractive unless you are skinny as a stick. I would suggest one size up. I have not tried to contact customer service yet but I see from other reviews it may be a nightmare. Over all the dress is very cute and summery.

I receive the discount on the purchase of these slippers in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. I am in no way associated with this company selling or product there for my feedback is reliable and trustworthy. My reviews are genuine and based solely on my experience with each product that I leave a review for regardless of whether I paid full price or receive the discount or free item for viewing purposes."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"I am 5'4"", 185 - 190Lbs, 38DDD bust, so I ordered this in a size 3X. I wanted so very badly to love this swimsuit. I saw it on one of the other reviewers and she rocked it. Unfortunately, that was not the case for me. It is sadly just not suited for my body. On me - it lets all of the wrong things hang out (I'll upload a photo to show what I mean). Fit wise, for the most part it did fit me as it should, even the breast area provided appropriate coverage. I just was not at all comfortable in this suit. I still gave it 3 stars because the return process was fast and easy. I won't say that there is anything wrong with this suit because as I stated the other reviewer looks fantastic in it and she says she feels great in it. Guess it's just not for everyone!!"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"I acknowledge, that I ordered these boots and others very quickly, as I got a great promotional price.

However, I did not realize that everything but the shoe part itself is quilted cloth! I honestly cannot believe it. However, it does say this in the written description. Also, the buckle is barely noticeable and it does not stand out at all. I had just ordered a Ralph-13 in pewter, and these are very different.

They do have a rugged sole that is good for walking in all kinds of weather. I have not worn them yet, but I have to say, I cannot personally see how the quilted fabric would be warmer than the material the shoe part is made of.

Honestly, these remind me of snow boots I may have worn as a kid. I definitely do not feel they are worth the money that is shown. I will keep them only because I got such fantastic deals on a number of boots."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"I bought one of these in large to try it out. The label was ""Urban Crews"". After washing it shrunk a little but was not a bad t-shirt for exercise (I like the extra length for stretching (no stomach shows)). I ordered another 2 shirts in XL Only ONE of the two were delivered. The label now said ""FWRD Denim Company"". It is a totally different type of material. Much cheaper and the make is also very cheap (not inexpensive...CHEAP).
So it appears the quality of the shirt you get is VERY haphazard. Is it Urban Crews or some place they farmed it out to.
The FWRD Denim Company shirt is made in Pakistan. It says it is 100% cotton just like the Urban Crew shirt but it does not absorb sweat like cotton. It just drips off like synthetic.
I would NOT recommend these. You have no idea what you will get. I'm going to try a Duluth Trading Company long tail tee. They are $19.50, made in USA and much better quality."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"I read a lot of reviews saying this had a small fit, almost an ""athletic fit"". I ordered an XL assuming the shirt would fit like a large. Well it didn't. 5'9"", 180, not skinny but not fat. I can tell you this shirt was huge. Pretty much a XXL. The picture shows the shirt being slim through the body but once i put it on there was lots of sleeve room and I had to bunch up, or fold over, the back of the shirt to make it look like the picture. The collar has some smaller, plastic- diamond studs to hold the collar down and the buttons are nice. I like the color of the shirt and the material was somewhat papery but I'm sure with a wash or two it would have been a softer material. I am to sure how the whole process of making and moving these shirts go, but I guarantee that the shirt I wore was not of the ""smaller fit"" batch some people are getting."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"I've worn these to my job at the sawmill (were I work outside in the cold) and so far I love them! They are not good for hiking around which I did in them the first day, but with some insoles in them, they have been very comfortable and warm! A little bigger than I expected but sometimes I wear two pair of socks so I think think I'll keep the size I have.
Waterproof so far and pretty warm! Except on wet metal (loader steps) very slip resistant. The laces are waayy too short so I had to replace them.
I had a very hard time trying to find good women's work boots with steel toe so I'm ecstatic to finally have some that had great reviews at a decent price and so far so good!

I lowered to a 3 from a 5.  The first pair were great but the second pair I bought took months to break in and caused so many blisters.  The waterproofing failed in one shoe fairly quickly so rainy days at work suck."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"I was excited to purchase these due to the pretty colors offered and the reviews posted. The first time I went to use them though, I regretted my decision. They are hard to attach and are impossible to put around a bra strap unless one is wearing a flimsy slip-type strap that is made for show rather than support. I will keep them but will now need to take the time and effort to sew on a different type of attaching device. These are clumsy at best and made for young teen-wear rather than a mature full figured-woman who needs these cover-ups. I suggest looking elsewhere unless you are attaching to very thin straps and have the time and dexterity to attach these clumsy made buttons. (They remind me of the old garter attachments that attached to hose..younger readers will be clueless about that comment) Also I am not certain about how the lace will hold up in the wash. They will probably need to be gently hand-washed as the lace is not the thicker quality I am use to."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"I have a black pair of these shoes, same shoes. They are size 81/2 Wide which is what I ordered in this shoe. But these white ones are much shorter probably 1/4 - 1/2"" shorter in the toes. So my toes are a little cramped. The bad thing about it was that I had already worn them out and about in town before I realized that they were so much smaller so I didn't really feel comfortable sending them back after wearing them for 4 or 5 hours. I  sure wish that I could have swapped them for a 9 wide but it is too late now because I have tried to tough it out and wear them anyway this week. But I will know next time to make sure that the shoe fits very well when I first put them on. I had a stroke 13 years ago and these are the only style shoe that I can wear now. Since they slide on and off so easily they are a great shoe for me to wear! I absolutely love these shoes!!!!"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"I was looking forward to receiving this robe. I appeared to be what I was looking for (except color). Unfortunately it won't do. The robe tie is woefully too short. It is so small that it just makes one tie and comes undone easily (!), can't have that now, can we? After two washings, it is starting the unraveling at the sleeves. Not much, but it does make me think this will be ratty looking in a year or so. It is lightweight which is nice for Arizona but not the softest material I've experienced. I have just ordered a bathrobe from another company and with hope, it will be what I was looking for.

One year later update:

For the price, this is a poor product. This is a $15 bathrobe that is good for a year of daily, yet light use. The seams are just giving away. There are numerous fabric strands all over the robe. It never was very soft. If I had paid $15, I would've just figured I got what I paid for. Not so with this robe at $40. I guess I'm looking for another robe one year later..."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"Please be aware that this backpack is seriously tiny. It's maybe a foot tall (just slightly taller than my Galaxy 4 phone) and as wide as my phone. This is my mistake since I didn't look at the size when I ordered it.  But it was suprising to see the small amazon box and wonder how they shoved a backpack into it (they didn't...it's little).The comb and mirror included are also itty bitty, but I'm an adult so these are not meant for my giant grown up lady hands.

It's a cute bag, the graphics look crisp, and for the price it's a good deal.

*I bought it for my friend's daughter, who is five. I'll be giving it to her in a few days, and if she likes it/it fits I'll be satisfied

Update: The backpack does indeed fit her, however it's on the loosest setting. She's a skinny little five-year-old, but she's kind of tall. So...I guess take that information as you will. She did like it though, and thought it was cute. I didn't see her use any of the hair things, but she thought the bag was cute and was excited about the hair clips."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"Debating returning this dress. I sized one size UP to size small. I normally wear a size 0 or extra small in Ann Taylor or Bebe.  The size small is just absolutely perfect. The dress is extremely gorgeous.  I'm 5 foot two and the height of it is just in the middle of my knee. So it really has it vintage look to it. So with all that said, what's my beef with it?  Well I purchased a burgundy which appears to be a beautiful raspberry on both my iPhone and iPad. And it actually truly is a very doll burgundy. Secondly I had expected a knit fabric and this is a broadcloth  type fabric, you know the type of men shirts are made out of but with lots of stretch to it. And I'm worried that the dye looks rather cheap, that it might wash out and look very very faded after only two or three washes. Debating....$20 is a lot of money to spend on a dress with this excellent cut but it is a lot of money for a dress that doesn't get worn because it looks like a tired old rag."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"Watch very easy to read dial- during day! At night, difficult- as the luminosity not all that and appears to fade out in darkness! Since the watch did not come with documentation and instructions, it took forever to set the day, date function, and time!  This means the watch does not have a SEIKO warranty! The band fits, but is very thin cheap like ans no solid feel! The chrome finish look, diminishes the quality look of good stainless steel! In trying to read the Serial Number and other details on back of watch, make sure to have a jeweler do it, as a 6x magnifying glass is difficult at best to  get the Seiko case numbers. I intend to call SEIKO with serial number at determine when the watch was made, as even solar batteries have limited life! Essentially I am very unhappy with this watch. I called Seiko C/S. They have no estimate of solar cell-battery. Cost to replace with shipping etc about $90. BEWARE of SOLAR watches! SEIKO 5 year warranty requires watch be sent to Seiko every 2.5 years to reseal etc/ cost to $90! Otherwise warranty void- VOID is the deal do not bujy solar watch from Seiko...."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,Let me start out by stating I bought this as a gift for my brother. It gets points for the outside appearance and the fact that it has actual glass and not cheap plastic. The latch is okay. It does the job but could be improved in quality.  On the inside the is where it appears cheap to me and how you hve to set up the dividers.  I think they were aiming for you to be able to customize the set up but it comes off cheap to me. The dividers feel like the re little more than felt covered cardboard. Maybe I didn't read the discription fully I will have to recheck but I thought the diveiders were built in and that is why I was most disappointed.  I do like the fact that the cushions are removable because that mens you can store more than just watches in this case. It works well for almost any men's jewelry. I went ahead and gave three stars because if it wasn't for the dividers I would have been pleased with the purchase and maybe a better latch.  Needs to be better priced for what it is though. Just in my opinion.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"This skirt is TINY & TIGHT. I'm talking SKIN-tight. For reference I'm 5'7 and 175 lbs I usually wear a size 10. I originally ordered a size XL (which according to the manufacturer is a size 14 - 16, which is WAY bigger than I ever wear). It was STILL TOO SMALL and insanely TIGHT. I ordered an XXL (which apparently is a size 18-20!!!!!) It's a bit looser around the waist, but still pretty tight the rest of the way down. Honestly - and surprisingly - this skirt is really probably most flattering on a smaller sized body - guess they don't call it a pencil skirt for no reason. I do think it's extremely cute though, despite it not being the best fit.

Two other things: you can absolutely see a panty-line. You can't see through all the way to the undies, but the line is quite obviously there.

Second, I ordered the ""coral"" color, which looks neon pink in the pictures, I was pleasantly surprised to find out when it arrived that it's actually not neon pink, but a very pretty baby-pink color. So, I have no idea what the actual ""pink"" shade looks like, since the coral color is actually a very pretty, light shade of pink...."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"Sizing I kept thinking, I'd hate to order these shoes and not have them fit. I read somewhere between 2030 reviews regarding Comfort and sizing. There were a significant number of complaints regarding the sizing of the shoes. 100% of the complaints were about over sizing issues. I normally wear a size 12 wide. But after reading the reviews and of course checking the sizing chart; I came to the conclusion that I would go with A size 11 1/2 m. With standard shipping (free) The shoes arrived in a timely manner. When I popped the shoes out of the box, I found a beautiful brown soft leather shoe. Now, I would not describe the shoe as a hightops or mids and of course they're not flip-flops. But the glove leather that does fit around your foot is just high enough that one would be only marginally wrong in calling them sandals. When I placed the shoes on my feet the length was perfect but the width was a different story. The width of the shoe on my left foot was dead-bang, whereas the right foot felt like it was in a vise grip. There was absolutely no problem with returning them. Called Amazon immediately and I was provided with a digital return label. Drop them in the mail and my account was credited. My only disappointment was that the shoe simply did not fit."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"No issue with the merchant - ClothingShopOnline shipped the item promptly and it was clearly brand-new - but I buy these extra-huge sizes to allow for the inevitable shrinkage in the wash.  I'm not a massive guy, just taller than most...and my goal is to start out with something closer to the size of a tent, and end up with something that fits after it's been washed.  So I tried this XXXL sweatshirt on and while it was good and roomy and baggy (as expected, remember, I want that extra room so that when it shrinks it'll be fine), the sleeves were just a hair longer than what would have been expected from an XL.  So right now, unwashed and right out of the box, the sleeve length is basically perfect.  Which means, once washed, these sleeves will be far too short.  Actually, I bet these *are* sleeves for an XL shirt; the seam at the shoulder is almost down to my bicep, meaning they added material in the torso area but not in the sleeves.  I have to laugh - what kind of individual must the manufacturer have been envisioning when determining what XXXL should be?  Maybe a three-foot-tall troll with little nubs for arms?  I'll probably keep it and just wash it in cold (and air dry it)...since the weight is nice and it seems to be of decent enough quality."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"I have a very high instep, got it from my grandma, and a bunch of family members suffer with the issue as well, including my son, aunt and sister.  Those are the ones I know about.  It's a problem for getting shoes that fit at all, especially shoes I can wear for any length of time.

Amazon is my go-to place for shoes that have the sizes I need.  There is no guarantee the shoes will be comfortable.  It's entirely the fault of my feet, and not the shoes.

The problem with a high instep is most shoes are not really comfortable.  This particular shoe cut into the top of my foot.  It's not a cut that bleeds, certainly, but it's definitely a huge indentation in the top of my foot, which goes away in a few hours.  I wore them for a wedding, my son's wedding, and I literally had to take them off to go down the stairs to walk down the aisle with my son and husband.  They were actually too big, and I was afraid they would fall off down the stairs, which would make me trip.

When I find a shoe that works for my feet and keeps my feet from pain, I will be faithful to the brand.  Skechers is one I can rely upon for the wide size I need and the comfort I deserve.

The price of these shoes was outstanding!"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"I can only blame myself for not looking through the negative reviews on this bra. Everything that people said is true.
The bra is cheap looking from thin cotton fabric. Really not intended for sizes bigger than C cup. Also might be uncomfortably tight for sizes over 36.  I ordered XL (I'm 38D -38DD) and this is definitely way too small. It's also uncomfortable tight around my chest so no way I can wear it at night.
For the poor quality it's clearly overpriced as well. I feel fooled by trusting Medela brand to have some understanding of a breastfeeding woman's anatomy.
The return policy is not mentioned anywhere and I made another mistake trusting that it would be something similar to amazon's - i.e, free return on clothing that is in unused condition. Well, silly of me. There is a 20% re-stocking fee, plus you have to pay shipping costs. Together this will come for me to about 7-8$ at least, half of the bra's price. Not to mention that I'll have to find time to go to the post office to send it (not something you are looking forward to when you just had a baby). Otherwise why would you shop online if you can go to the store to find bra that fits?
While I understand the reasons behind the return policy on things bought from a third party through Amazon, I wish I was better informed about it before I spent money on this bra."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"Functional, yes. Durable? We didn't get off to a great start together, this Pescadero 20 Carry-on and me.

I opened the package to find a loose zipper pull falling out at me and I couldve just ended my review there. Based on the other reviews, Im not the only person that received a flawed item out of the box. Id be wary of it and Id be wary that the other zipper pulls won't last. My internal zipper for the liner on the side of the handle also was missing a zipper pull altogether.

In terms of actually using the Pescadero to travel, it does reasonably well and holds itself up as a four-wheel spinner should, including its telescoping handle. I took it on a car trip, which is probably as much as I care to trust it. I like that its lighter than other 20-inchers Ive used before, although you can pay a premium for lighter weight specs if you choose elsewhere.

However, for flying, I don't like that it doesnt have any other exterior access compartment, nor does it have a TSA lock and no internal pockets. For a hard-shell exterior, its less rigid compared to my current hardshell. I can push the exterior in too easily with my hand alone. I cant put my trust in it and leave a proven, durable case behind when it will inevitably get checked and beaten on by baggage handling.

If I cant trust it, it doesnt fly with me. I expected better for the price."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"Revised review Dec. 2015:  I finally gave up on these and put them on Ebay!  Impossible boots.  Hard as a rock, NEVER got soft, even after mink oiling, baking, stretching... they were more like torture devices than shoes.  Could not wear them long enough to even begin to break them in, if I walked more than 2 minutes, I got enormous blisters on my heels.  Too much pain for the price!!  A lot of people here seem to love Fryes, but I will never go near a pair again.

--------------

I dithered for months before finally pulling the trigger on these pricey boots.  Can't say I love them...yet.  Well made, but for me the styling is a little off.  The foot is narrow, which isn't bad but I was looking for a ""clunkier"" motorcycle-type boot.  Had them stretched for both length and width.  And the bottom of the sole is very flat and very hard, makes a slapping noise when you walk - !!  Which I personally don't care for.  I guess I was expecting softer rubber with maybe a little tread.  These are almost like riding boots.  Have not even worn them enough to break them in.  Honestly, the $60 Steve Maddens (discontinued, alas!) are more comfortable and more to my liking.  I will come back to these in the fall and see if I can make them work.  Quality-wise, they're great, so no problem there."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"It took some time to figure out how to put it on after reading other reviews about how it didn't work looped around the ring band and to just put it on first then put your ring on. I can tell you that putting the ring sizer band on first and then your ring was a big fail. It works better looped around the band and then slid the bands down your finger around the area the ring will sit, make sure the looped area on the ring is turned towards your palm side and then stretch the bands a bit to get you ring on and slide into place. The bands are comfortable but do peak out of the band, and I have a pretty wide ring. I keep tucking them back under the ring. I haven't broken one yet but my wife is on her second one already and it hasn't even been a week. I think she should have gotten a size smaller on the bands and thats why it broke. Our rings sizes fell within the size range of the large so thats what I bought. If your on the low end of that range order the next size down! I would buy a multi pack because I can totally see I'll be going through another one soon! It looks like a small tear in the band is starting. If you take your rings on and off often your wasting your time because your going to wear these bands out super quick!"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"This dres arrived dirty and extremely wrinkled, I know for a fact this item was returned by a previous owner or it was used on some kind of display. I received the dress the day before I needed it for my daughter so I could not return it in time to get another one. It had brown make up on parts of the dress, which I had to clean with make up remover and baby wipes.

The dress was extrely wrinkled due to the fact that the dress was STUFFED back into it's packaging. So I had to give it a good steaming job before it even stared to look decent. The same previous owner must have reinforced the flower appliques on the dress with a hot glue gun because there were dried glue strings hanging from the flowers.

The quality of the dress: it was ok considering that it is a child's play dress. Compared to other children at my daughter's school who also wore princess dresses, this one held up a day of playing, running, swinging, rolling of the ground/grass much better than the others.

My daughter did not complain of anything being itchy on the inside, which I was thankful for. I say that because the tulle fabric overlay on the outside is very stiff, as if it was treated/sprayed with a fabric stiffener or something.

The back of the dress has a little circle velcro closure piece that does not stick very well.

The dress does comes with the  crown that you see in the pictures...but it does not come with a wand though."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"This is my third pair of Dickies brand work pants. Two of the three pairs - in different styles, have similar problems.

I'm about 5'7"", 125 lbs and the size 4 is the right size for me. Unfortunately, in Dickies' carpenter style, the waist is higher and wider than their cargo workpant style. I have wide hips and a small waist, so after purchasing a pair of the cargo pants and liking the style and fit, I was disappointed when I tried these on. These pants ride higher and looser in the waist than other Dickies.

Other reviewers have stated how rugged the material is. I would add the caveat that it's rugged--by Women's clothing standards. This isn't fashion attire, but it isn't the heavy duck cloth typical in many Men's work pants, either. I can't speak to the working conditions of other people, but I work in a factory alongside men and the work I perform puts the same strains on my clothes - it would be nice if my clothes could last as long. These pants are new, so we'll see.

These pants had frayed seams right out of the bag. I examined the seams closely, and it appears to be cosmetic (the fringe of the under-layer of fabric didn't lay quite right when the crotch seams were stitched) - not structural. As this is the second pair I've gotten with seam problems, I'd say Dickies has a quality control problem.

Pros:
Good quality materials
Good length and style
Rear pockets big enough for my wallet

Cons:
Material could be more rugged
Inconsistent sizing across styles
Poor assembly at seams - fraying sewn in at crotch"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"I almost loved these shoes...I do really like them.  My 3 year old has wide feet and he really likes slip on ""boat shoes"".  The problems with those shoes are they get stinky and he falls in them.  I looked at alllll the shoes on Amazon and these were my number one choice.  Visually I love the color combination.  The velcro strap fits great and the shoes are easy for him to put on and take off by himself.  He ran like a crazy man the first time he wore them and he was super excited that he didn't fall down!  I feel like much of the comfort comes from the width in addition to the general support provided from the shoe.  My only real complain is that after a week of so the shoes had little fuzzies from the material all over the gray part of the shoe.  I'm sure I could probably pick them off, but I don't have time for that.  They are still great as far a comfort and function, they just lost the new look a bit quicker than I anticipated.  I definitely recommend these shoes for anyone who has a kiddo with wide feet!
**This is my first New Balance purchase and I will definitely check out what they have available when purchasing his next pair of shoes**

***ETA***  I purchased these shoes at the end of March.  It is now the beginning of July and I am bummed out that my kiddo has somehow worn a hole in the toe of both shoes.  They were definitely great while they lasted!"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"I purchased 2 bras....this one and the Bali Women's Smooth U Front Close Bra.  I prefer T-back style bras because I absolutely hate when a bra strap falls down on your arms.  I am 135 pounds, 5'1"" and about a C cup.  I used the measurement advice found on the descriptions, and it showed me to be a 36C.  I am returning this bra for the following reasons:  1. The material is thin.  No padding, just a stretchy fabric.  I didn't realize this, so I guess I missed that in the description.  I might have kept it had it fit.  2. I had ""fall out"" all around the cup.  Not just a little, but a lot.  The straps were tight, and it goes up high on the collar bone, so there was literally breast poking out all the way up to the shoulders and collar bones area.  Have never had that experience before.  I loosened the straps to the lowest/longest position, and it only lightened the ""squish"" a little bit.  Still fall-out.  3. it was scratchy.  And to top it off, it was an expensive bra. THe other one I ordered (Bali) was only $16...and it fit like a dream.  Lots of support, comfortable, could sleep in it if i had to.  I know that Wacoal is a good bra maker, but I was looking for features that this particular bra did not deliver.  I don't know if a 38C or a 36D would have been the right choice with this bra, it definitely felt too small, but the 36C with the Bali was perfect."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"I had compared the dimensions on the site to a fleece jacket I had and the Condor came up a little short (less than 1/2 inch though) in each dimension compared to the fleece dimensions.  I ordered the 3X (there is no 4X).  It is a nice jacket, I just do not like the way it drapes on the body.  The Spandex does not really allow it drape anyway.  I am 6 feet plus and about 260 pounds.  It does fit snugly but I think it is really the Spandex.  If I could relax the Spandex a bit, I would really like this jacket.  I love the number of pockets, especially the fore arm pocket.  I use it for my ID card.  I love the hood with the visor.  I wear it to work over a tee shirt and polo shirt normally.  I would say it would be comfortable no lower than the high 40s F by itself.  You could extend that if you wore a fleece or sweater underneath.  It is more comfortable in the 50s F though.  I have worn it in some pretty good wind and rain storms.  Wind intrusion is not a problem.  So far, the rain has not penetrated the material either.  The slash pockets are a little high up for me though.  It could be an inch or 2 longer in the overall length.  It could also be a bit more packable.  I wanted it to roll up in the bottom of my work back pack for when I travel.  Does not really lend itself to that though."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"There were three questions I had in mind when I received these gloves in the mail:
1) How well do they work on touch screens (""capacitive material"")?
2) Will they keep my hands warm (""Cold Weather Gear"")?
3) Will they last?

1) When I first opened these gloves, my first take was that they were merely knit gloves with different thread color on the finger tips.  But after putting them on and looking closer, the three finger tips (first two fingers + thumb) are indeed made of a different material that provided a high degree of responsiveness on our iPad.  Score one for the gloves!  Alas, I had less luck with my iPhone, where my thumb is needed for typing.  There is a seam that runs across the top of the thumb exactly where my fingers come into contact with iPhone, rendering the ""Capacitive Material"" useless.  WIth a slight roll of my thumb, or shifting of the seam, I could get them to work properly.  But definitely a design flaw.

2) I ran an errand first thing the next morning - about 25 degrees outside.  Based on the knit material, I was less than surprised to discover these gloves lack sufficient warming properties to qualify is ""Cold Weather Gear.""  I would not recommend these much below 45 or 50 degrees.

3) The material is highly porous with skin visible through the material.  There were loose threads as well, straight out of the package.

If you are going to use these in a cooler room, or in mild weather, they could work for you.  But don't plan to wear them in truly cold weather, or expect to get much long term use out of them."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"I have worn Levi and Wrangler jeans for over 40 years. In recent years I have not been able to find Levi branded jeans in my local Target and Walmart stores. Several pairs of Levi jeans have been worn until they have become threadbare. I love them but replacement has been needed. After looking in Target and Walmart stores I could not find the Levi brand. The  stocked Wrangler brand is decent and costs $ 20 - 25. The  Wrangler sizes are very inconsistent and each pair should be tried on to verify that they fit properly. No two pair seem the same.  However, The Levi brand jeans always fit better and sizing seemed consistent. The Levi denim fabric was a heavier material than the Wrangler brand.

Not having a local source for the Levi brand, I ordered through Amazon. The jeans were about $ 40 vs. the $ 25 Wranglers
available locally. Upon arrival I immediately noted the denim fabric was much thinner than even the Wranglers. As a matter of fact, it was the same thin fabric used on the Walmart house branded jeans.

The zipper and zipper pull were SMALL... much smaller than anything I have ever seen on a pair of adult  jeans. The zipper and pull looked like what used to come on my son's boy jeans.

Last, the jean's waist and length were at least 2 inches large. Years ago, Levi jeans tended to be a bit tighter than other brands.

In summary, the fabric, the zipper, and inconsistent sizes are all  very sub-par. The insult of paying an extra premium price for something much inferior to the Wrangler brand has been a big disappointment.

This pair was made in Egypt with Egyptian fabric.

Avoid mail order Levi jeans"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"These gloves fit really snug (Medium). I had tried some on at a local shop in Large, which I knew would be too big (baggy in the fingertips). I also took the advice of another rider who reminded me that most gloves stretch a bit over time. Despite being tough to get on and off, they didn't bind and were very comfortable when riding my recumbent or my upright.

I had hoped they'd be a little warmer, but overall I still like them.

Only real complaints:

--The velcro strap at the wrists is small and looks flimsy. I can see this breaking in the future. On the upside, they are so snug and have a little bit of a ""cuff"" so even if the strap breaks the gloves would be perfectly functional (the strap is almost superfluous).

--I would have expected a longer cuff towards the wrists for a winter-intended glove, and one they advertise as water resistant. Getting a jacket over the cuff really won't work very well: isn't long enough and no real edge to keep the jacket cuff from riding up your arm. Thankfully, I have dedicated rain gloves for wet riding.

UPDATE 3/21/17: downgraded from 4 stars to 3
The outside of the index finger on the gloves is wearing through, especially the right glove. I assume this is because of shifting or perhaps some other abrasion? It may seem harsh to downgrade from 4 to 3 stars after a little over 3 years of daily use for 6 months a year, but there was a time when even inexpensive cycling gloves would last many more years than this, so it's a bit of a disappointment.

I will likely not buy again, might see what Giro has to offer (since I like their Zero gloves for the summer)."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"**UPDATED**
I adjusted the watch band by taking out one link and it was the most difficult watch I have ever adjusted.  I have watch tools and have adjusted, fixed and worked on a number of watches and other jewelry.  Getting the pin back in proved extremely difficult.  Once you pull it out the other piece of the band moves and it is very difficult to line it back up and get the pin inserted again.  typically this is a 5-10 minute job but with this watch it took hours.  After wearing the watch for 2 weeks, it literately fell off my wrist one day.  Lest you think I did not adjust it properly, it was the other side of the band not even close to the the adjustment I made.  I was not doing anything strenuous either, unless you consider typing on a laptop strenuous.  Because of this I have had to downgrade my rating for 4 to 2 stars.  Very disappointing!

If you are looking for a nice looking watch with little options at a good price this might be the watch for you.  This watch will not give you the date, does not have a faceplate light or glow, but it does keep good time and it looks very nice.  It is lighter weight than you might expect but seems to hold up fine with normal wear.  If you are concerned about a watch you can wear in the pool or need to see the date this isn't for you.  Overall this is good watch for the guy who wants to not spend a lot but have a good looking watch on his wrist.

I have been wearing it nearly every day since it arrived and have been quite happy with it."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"i ordered it awhile back and i did not receive this the first time and i had to deal with customer service. after messaging back and forth they wanted me to pay 1/2 price again to reship the item and said that i even signed for it. so here are parts out off the messages. ""Dear yourparcel,

I don't see why i should have to pay anything at all, i fulfilled my end by paying the first time and i have not received your item. on top you said i signed for it so i would appreciate it if you could get a copy and  email it to me so i can see where i supposedly signed for the shipment i have not received. if yourparcel is not willing to send an other one out to no cost to me, i would appreciate a full refund so i can give my money to an other company where it is more appreciated and where they won't try to make a fool out of me. ""

they replied

""OKAY!I have reshipped it with a new tracking number. Hope you are satisfied with our customer service. Have a great day!!""

today i finally got it and i tried it on and it does not look anything like the picture. it fits like size m but just doesn't look like the picture which was why i ordered it in the first place. if you are size s and m and want this to look like the picture you need to order it in the biggest size they have or it will not look anything like shown above. one more complaint the one ""arm cuff"" is tighter than the other. i will not order from them again. waist of time and money would not even rate it at all if i could."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"I walk on a treadmill for exercise & wear an orthotic insert. The size shoe that accommodates the insert is loose & slips around on my foot while exercising. I have come up with a variety of techniques to compensate: multiple shoe laces, moleskin padding. A thick sock is essential. I ordered 2 pair Thorlos Women's Thick Cushion Distance Walking Quarter Socks April 14, 2010 @ $12.59 a pair, free shipping form Footsmart w/ $25 purchase. The socks were indeed very thick and worked well protecting my foot from pressure & sliding. I ordered 2 new pair Nov 19, 2010, same item, same price, same shipping deal, but not the same sock. These are significantly thinner, when I opened the package the difference was evident. I thought perhaps the original socks had shrunk in length in the wash producing the thicker cushion. However when I tried them on the length was already snug so that hope died and subsequent washing did not affect the cushion. The socks are not bad socks but I would never have invested another $25 if this is what I had rec'd the first time.
 Bottom line: if you are looking for the sock you purchased before: this isn't it. If you are looking for a very thick, cushiony sock: this isn't it.

Additional comment, 3/26/2011. I retained the packaging from my later order hoping to compare to the previous order & get a clue to the change. These socks were 'small.' This accounts for the smaller overall size but not for the change in padding. This is another example of inconsistencies from merchant to merchant & product to product. Most pages for socks have a selection for size on the page. Here there were different pages. My search for style & brand took me to this product as the size I ordered previously is no longer available on Amazon."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,So I gave three but I wanted to give two stars. This is very expensive first off to not be a great product. Now the sizing I would def size up if you don't like it to be so tight. As the day goes on it becomes irritating. Because it's tight. Now I am a large and I started wearing it 3 weeks after my pregnancy. Which I had lost most of my weight. I had two kids back to back: I am 5.1 tall and weigh post pregnancy 150. Pregnancy I was 191! So actually I was more of xl but I got large. Anyhow it def fits snug. But the top of it does roll down and I read other reviews and hoped it didn't but guess what it rolls down. I find asking my husband to pull it up. Then being large chest I find it hard to snap everything together. So if you have that issue get something easier to pull up. I had c-section. Which this didn't make it that comfortable near the incision. It does give support for my back. I don't wear it much maybe if it was softer and comfortable I would! Really if you read this review try others that are cheaper. The hospital gave me a wrap to help but it wasn't that great but it def much better than this! I will post pic later. Oh it also squeeze my back fat and made it worse! Very disappointed overall and the return policy sucks cause you have to keep the tags on it. Heck you should be able to return in 30 days regardless. It even made me feel tummy aches. It will flatten you stomach while wearing it though only good thing really but it's not by much. You just gotta really work out and eat well! Eventually you will get the body back!
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"I can only give this item two stars.  That is because I like the print and the material, and the overall design of the dress.
I am a U.S. size 8/9.  I have recently lost weight, so Ihave trouble sizing online items sometimes. I first ordered a U.K. size 14 in this dress, then a U.K. size 12.  I don't know if they do things much different in the UK but it seems I must be a non-existent size which is in between the two previously mentioned sizes.
The size 12 is extremely tight.  It fits well in the hip and midsection area but is ridiculously tight in the chest area....to the degree that it smashed my breasts into pretty much two flat pancakes that looked really unusual from a side profile.  Boobs are supposed to be round.  I needed help getting in and out of the dress, since there is no zipper, I struggled pulling it over my head.  The size 14 was way too large...the dress fit baggy and awkward everywhere.  There was more than enough room in the chest area (surprisingly) but that meant that the bottom half of the dress was huge around my hips.  It wasn't flattering at all because the dress didn't have any need to cling or stretch to anything, it just hangs there.

I don't care to return these dresses because the shipping rate will probably cost more than the dress itself, so i'll probably sell them.  Long story short, this is a beautifully designed dress but PLEASE be careful if you are a busty woman because it may not flatter you but FLATTEN you.  Also, the fit of this dress may make you consider if this is a dress for a night out, or if it's work-appropriate.
This would work well for a woman with a small chest but ample hips.

For reference, I am 5'3, 140lbs, 36D-29-39.  Hope this helps someone."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"These shoes are so comfortable you will not want to take them off.  Even my sensitive feet with bunions are very happy in them.  True, they are not very elegant, since they look somewhat bulky, but at this point I prefer comfort over style.  The inner sole is soft suede with some cushioning underneath. I don't think the insole is real suede, rather it is microfiber and the upper lining is definitely synthetic fabric.

I bought black size 9.5 M and they are both slightly longer (26.7 cm=10.5 in) and seem wider than most medium widths since the fabric mesh allows more width flexibility above the sole.  They are not suitable for persons with very low or very high insteps as the zipper on top does not provide any width regulation (unless you leave the zipper partially open). The upper opening does not fit snugly on my low instep foot.  However the back sling has some elastic under the buckle, so the length is flexible and can be additionally adjusted by pin holes - I had to use the first pin hole. So, I would label them at least 9.5 W. I lowered the rating for incorrect sizing to fours stars.

The insole has perforations under the ball of the foot, which means the moisture gets under the lining and ... the odor stays longer. I used them in tropical weather (on a cruise, both on the ship and on the land) for less than a month and they already stink, though I do not have any sweating problem.

I also got surprised that my French shellac pedicure got stained, not only on the white strips, but on the clear body of the nails as well. My black microfiber suede tote bag also stained my French manicure, so this is the fault of the fabric stain (and shellac polish vulnerability). Maybe the light colored sandals don't stain though.

I lowered the ratings to three after one month due to these two problems."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"I'm a 36B, which means that I don't need any heavy-duty compression with exercise (I'm a light jogger), and this bra is labeled as a ""medium support bra,"" which I was fine with--I was just hoping to avoid the typical sports bra uni-boob. I'd read the negative reviews from others who brought this bra, in which they noted that the bra didn't provide enough support--which made sense to me, once I saw the fabric in the bra cups, which consists of a fine and breathable mesh material...and my guess is that it wouldn't do such a great job of keeping your nipples from showing through a t-shirt.

Anyway, I do think the bra is well-made, and this company is known for it's quality products, but here's my major complaint and advice to you regarding this bra: if you're a size C cup or smaller, don't bother (or those with C cups should consider the B cup), because the 36B bra that I purchased had huge, loose, silly cups...I put the thing on, and I started laughing at myself in the mirror. It was obvious that, in order for me to fill the bra cups, I needed to almost triple my cup size. Seriously. It was hilarious. I'd say that the only people who would benefit from this bra are those busty ladies looking for a basic, mildly supportive sports bra for the type of exercise that yields little-to-no boob bouncing--like on an elliptical machine, or slow-paced walking. Or perhaps for those busty ladies who don't exercise at all, but just need a bit of lifting and separating...

I'm open to suggestions from anyone who actually wears a 36B (nothing bigger--there are plenty of bra reviews out there from those with larger cup sizes that I can refer to) and can advise on a sports bra that's less than $50, does not lead to uni-boob, and actually provides at least medium support. I also think it would be great if Amazon came up with an option to search and read bra reviews based on your actual size..."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,negative,truthful,"You can wear the hood by itself, wear it with the hood, or wear just the jacket without the hood.  How is that for 3-in-1 systems?

Reminiscent of what Lands End sells as a ""Squall Jacket"", or what uniform and corporate wear sellers call a Three Season Jacket.

Water and wind resistant shell.  Microfleece lined body.  Smooth polyester lining in sleeves.  Left hand side, Napoleon style, inside pocket with a hook and loop closure.  Adjustable sleeve cuffs.  Hemline cinch cord with toggles.  Molded plastic chain style, off brand, slide fastener.

Polyester insulation is spilling out due to poor quality stitching.  Item was delivered with a broken main zipper.

I can wear this jacket over just a t-shirt, and expect to stay warm @ 72 degrees Fahrenheit, and no wind.

If it was foggy, or there's a light drizzle, I would have no problem depending on this jacket to go 300 - 500 feet in order to get to my car in the parking lot.

Better garments feature Gore-Tex, Hippora, HyVent, DWR.....this jacket features no technology.  You're just hoping that the polyester does not saturate as you're trying to get where you're going.  You will not be going for bike rides, checking your property's fence line by horseback, riding a motorcycle, playing golf, pier fishing, lap dancing, picking strawberries, calling ducks, or anything else in the rain.

I guess if you name your company, 32Degrees Weatherproof, the customer does not have a reasonable expectation that your garments will keep them dry & warm.

Garment fits tight across the shoulders, back, chest, and arms.  Go 1 size up if you intend on layering.

I've purchased other items from this manufacturer, and frankly, this item was a let down.  It's not warm enough when I need it to be warm.  I put on a few layers, and it is too tight.  I need to stay dry, and I'm sooooo wet.

And to sell a jacket as a 3-in-1 systems jacket........it needs to really be a 3-in-1 systems jacket.  This jacket does not have a removeable liner!"
